**[00:00:01 - 00:00:12]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:13]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:15]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:16]** Get out.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:20]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:22]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:23 - 00:00:30]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:33]** Unknown treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:00:57 - 00:01:02]** Welcome back to another episode of Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_0

**[00:01:04 - 00:01:04]** Woo!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:04 - 00:01:05]** Woo woo woo!

**[00:01:05 - 00:01:06]** I'm your GM Kevin.

**[00:01:06 - 00:01:07]** Yeah.

**[00:01:07 - 00:01:09]** I like to call you cats.

**[00:01:10 - 00:01:11]** What is Kevin short for?

**[00:01:11 - 00:01:13]** Kevin's short for Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:14 - 00:01:16]** But there must have been a meaning way in the past.

**[00:01:17 - 00:01:18]** It's short for Kelvin.

**[00:01:18 - 00:01:19]** Let me see if I can find out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:20 - 00:01:21]** It's short for Kelvin.

**[00:01:21 - 00:01:22]** Man, I don't know.

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:25]** Roll a culture check.

**[00:01:25 - 00:01:29]** I was just going to say, GMing, I'll be honest, GMing is hard.

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:31]** I don't like it.

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:32]** It's tough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:32 - 00:01:32]** Yeah.

**[00:01:32 - 00:01:34]** How's your experience going overall, though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:35]** Overall, it's a lot of fun.

**[00:01:36 - 00:01:42]** I have a lot of fun prepping GMing, but once we're in it and you guys are asking me questions, I get a little flustered and I'm like, I don't know.

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:43]** I don't know the answers.

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:52]** The way I describe it is that GMing is like designing and prepping a drag racer.

**[00:01:52 - 00:02:19]** to find out you're going on like a mountain rally course yeah so you're just like oh man this thing's only good for straight straight lines but we're going off this cliff so let's do it um you just gotta work with it full send yeah full send full send dude otherwise it's a lot of fun you guys are always a blast to hang out with so hey thanks what's uh what's your what's your favorite metaphor for gma mine i'll go first it's like building one of those cat hotels and watching the cats play with the box yeah

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:25]** I was going to say, herding cats is how I've described you guys as herding cats to other GMs.

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:29]** Hashtag Jeremy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:32]** That is every GM.

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:34]** That's every GM experience.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:34]** I'll be honest.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:41]** Last episode, I had a full set of questions and answers prepped.

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:43]** I'm like, oh, if they ask these questions...

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:51]** And you guys didn't ask a single one of the questions I had prepped, but you danced around every one of them and asked stuff otherwise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:53 - 00:03:01]** You basically plan a bank heist and everyone else gets to decide whether the theme is Mission Impossible or Benny Hill.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:04]** Yeah, that's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:05]** Otherwise, it's an absolute blast.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:07]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:15]** I don't have a question ready for you guys, but... Is there a question that we should have asked that you're just going to roll in later or something from last time?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:17]** That's a question I'm not ready to answer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:20]** We have a correction from last time, which is... We do have a correction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:24]** I was going to wait until gameplay for that, but yes, we suck at math on this game.

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:27]** I suck at math.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:35]** I added plus five to my slam ability when I should have added only plus four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:36]** Yeah, so...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:47]** So I got a nine points against your foolishly brave pot valiant minion who is about to die.

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:48]** About to die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:49]** Hands down about to die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:50]** About to die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:54]** We don't have a game of Two Truths and a Lie to play.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:55]** Because we finished it.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:58]** But I was going to go around the room and just ask, what are you drinking?

**[00:03:59 - 00:03:59]** I'll start.

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:03]** I have an almost empty can of Be More Sour.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:05]** Be More Sour?

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:05]** Yeah.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:12]** I have a bottle of Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA, which is also almost empty.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:14]** And then I have an almost full bottle of Dr. Pepper.

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:17]** That's what I'm coasting with.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:19]** Vinny, what do you got going on in your glasses?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:22]** I've got an empty Glencairn.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:28]** I had, at the start of last episode, some Blantons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:29]** Two weeks or a week ago?

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:30]** A week ago.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:32]** A week ago you were drinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:35]** I savor, I drink it really, really slow.

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:36]** Dude, that's real slow, man.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:37]** That's real slow.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:40]** I've got a bottle of Matz apple juice.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:42]** And I don't know.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:47]** I think I might go next with a vodka that I like from Texas, I think.

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:49]** It's Southern Suns.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:51]** Southern Suns.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:52]** That's cool.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:54]** As long as it's not Tito's.

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:55]** Southern Suns.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:58]** Is Southern Suns S-U-N or S-O-N?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:59 - 00:04:59]** S-O-N.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:00]** Okay.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:03]** Though I think the logo is like the day star sun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:04]** A little play on words.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:05]** That's cool.

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:06]** Kelly, what are you drinking?

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:09]** I'm going to drink some... And water is a perfectly acceptable answer.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:10]** Is that coffee?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:11]** He's drinking coffee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:13]** French press coffee.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:41]** I'm into that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:49]** It wasn't until my honeymoon that I realized that coffee beans actually come from a cherry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:50]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:51 - 00:07:01]** And we went to this coffee farm in Kona, Hawaii, and they actually had a coffee that...

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:18]** that was mixed with um it was they didn't they didn't de uh fruit it normally they they pull the fruit off of it and take just the the seed essentially the coffee bean is actually a seed um but this coffee had the the berry still on it when they dried it out and turned it into coffee


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:47]** and um it actually has like an almost sweet taste to it it's one of the few coffees that i like just straight coffee yeah because it's not a coffee anymore it's i would try that yeah it was worth it it sounds kind of good speaking of will what are you drinking um earlier i was enjoying some old forester in my old fashion uh but now i'm since i am in the desert i am drinking water


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:48]** Oh, yeah, that's smart.

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:50]** You should probably stay hydrated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:51]** Stay hydrated, everyone.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:53]** Stay hydrated, folks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:57]** If you haven't thought about drinking water today, this is your... This is your reminder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:57 - 00:08:00]** You should be having at least one liter of water a day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:07]** Did I ever tell you about... This is more Navy... But I'm sure it's in all military branches, especially in boot camp.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:11]** They had a poster on the wall in the bathrooms that basically said, like...

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:13]** It was color coded.

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:18]** And if it was clear white, it was like, you don't need to hydrate, but keep drinking.

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:21]** And then it just goes like darker and darker.

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:27]** And basically like the second one down, it was like drink a canteen within the next half hour.

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:32]** And then like the bottom one is like second to the bottom one is drink two canteens immediately.

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:34]** The last one says like, go see a doctor.

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:38]** I don't want to talk about this.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:41]** Yeah.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:42]** John, what are you drinking?

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:43]** Wait, wait, wait.

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:43]** Hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:45]** Let me drink my orange yellow drink.

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:57]** I am drinking Celsius, which is my favorite energy drink that's also purportedly healthy.

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:59]** And yes, I'm drinking the orange flavor.

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:02]** I actually got the powder mix in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:03]** Because it's a better bang for your buck.

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:06]** That looks like you need to drink two cantinas immediately.

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:08]** Dude, it is good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:12]** A beet supplement for circulation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:13]** That's how you know.

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:17]** Those are also interesting peas.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:20]** I don't know why I keep coming back to that.

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:23]** You're the person driving this.

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:24]** Do you have to cut these things?

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:25]** We're not going to cut it.

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:26]** We're just going to stop.

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:27]** We're stopping right here.

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:31]** Okay, well, if you ever eat beets and then your pee is red, it's okay.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:32]** No, Kelly, we're stopping.

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:34]** I'm finished.

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:34]** I'm done.

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:35]** It was a PSA.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:39]** Please, jump on our Discord and tell us about your problems that you have going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:42]** We are not doctors, but we do have a medical channel.

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:43]** No, we don't have a medical channel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:46]** No, we should not have a medical channel.

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:46]** No, we don't.

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:47]** Yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:51]** One day, we'll save the doctors.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:52]** Dr.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:53]** O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:57]** 's office hours are not existent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:57 - 00:10:01]** I'm not that kind of doctor.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:05]** I think you just need to give bad Starfinder medical advice.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:06]** It's a tweet every once in a while.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:10]** Yeah, just always prescribe poisons and inhibitors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:10]** I love that.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:13]** You should take magic mushrooms.

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:15]** All right, Kev, what's going on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:19]** Why are these douchebags attacking us again?

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:20]** You mean in the game?

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:22]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:22]** Yeah, we can play.

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:23]** Let's play.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:24]** You want to play?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:24]** I'll play.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:25]** Alright, we're playing.

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:26]** I'm going to ask.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:27]** I'm asking politely.

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:29]** The music's already started, so we're playing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:29]** Yeah.

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:32]** Alright, so let's do a little run back.

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:32]** Just rewind.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:35]** So last week...

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:37]** You guys talked to Riddle inside of Junkers Delight.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:38]** Yeah.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:49]** She explained to you that Dotrulu and the True Warriors are squeezing the junk tourism trade and that she is a part of that.

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:58]** She is actually the last standing junk guide adventurer group that's not given in to paying protection money to Dotrulu.

**[00:10:58 - 00:11:00]** Which is funny because I...

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:06]** Paying protection to the organized crime that is doing the violence.

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:07]** It's just very ironic.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:15]** But along with that, you guys explained to her pretty explicitly that your goal is to kill Dotrulo.

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:16]** That's it.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:17]** That's your only goal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:18]** We never sent you this.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:22]** We said we have a proposition for meeting them and, like, forming a business deal.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:23]** That was the implied.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:26]** That's what you told to the Hilkies.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:27]** Yeah.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:31]** We told her we're trying to merc Dotrulo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:35]** What we said was we were going to leave the details to ourselves.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:59]** okay i see what you're saying that is actually what we said that is actually what we said kev so i think after after she asked you not to to like whatever you do with him i don't want to know but yeah she she didn't say that nothing to do with it she just said are you going to help me with very 13 and we were like right so as long as we could get to detroit and we didn't yeah we riddles we said we had bigger fish to fry


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:13]** Riddle's concern is her last and only client, Vary13, who is an android that has a lot of wealth and is seeking information about something that can, quote-unquote, change the galaxy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:21]** If you want to go back and listen to episode one... I've already bolded and did all that stuff for that phrase, change the galaxy.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:23]** Change the galaxy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:26]** A reincarnated Vary8, which, I mean... Oh!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:26]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:27]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:27]** What?

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:29]** Somebody listened.

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:31]** Somebody paid attention.

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:32]** It was great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:34]** Wait, I listened to you, Kev.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:34]** Wait, wait, wait.

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:37]** So the numbers are actually reincarnations.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:38]** Do they keep their memories?

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:39]** Yeah.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:40]** I actually knew that already.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:41]** I didn't know that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:43]** So it's Starfinder Storytime.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:43]** Go for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:47]** Starfinder Storytime.

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:49]** Starfinder Storytime.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:50]** Starfinder Storytime.

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:52]** Starfinder Storytime.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:53]** Starfinder Storytime.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:55 - 00:13:13]** But androids are constructed beings and whenever they pass away, their bodies stay intact and they are basically another soul can enter their body and take over.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:17]** And traditionally, you would keep the name of the current body and then move it on.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:20]** So Vary 8 turned into Vary 9.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:22]** And Vary 9 turned into Vary 10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:24]** So there's been 19 wrecks.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:25]** Holy crap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:28]** Vinny, can you add these notes to our notes?

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:32]** Because if you were taking these notes separately, I would like to have that because I'm not the best at taking notes.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:34]** Didn't write it down.

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:34]** I just knew it.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:35]** All from the noggin.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:36]** Off the dome.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:40]** Okay, well, get on the notes page so you can add this in.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:40]** This is important.


## Speaker_0

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:41]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:55]** But so Vahri 13, who is a descendant of Vahri 8, is out seeking some kind of treasure that could change the galaxy in Kefauk Depot.

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:57]** Whatever she's looking for is in Kefauk Depot.

**[00:13:57 - 00:14:03]** And so she hired the last guide from Riddle, Lorgon.

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:06]** to guide her out into the car yards for something.

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:11]** But they haven't been heard of or heard from in two days.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:11]** Yes.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:16]** And so Riddle has asked you guys, she said, I will pay you 500 credits each.

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:24]** If you bring back Vahri 13 alive and in one piece, she had to clarify that because Chak was like, well, what if we bring you just an arm?

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:30]** Yeah, no, they need to be... She said 500 creds per piece.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:32]** Per person.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:33]** She said a piece.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:35]** That's all I'm saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:38]** Yeah, I could see her... He was transcribing as she said that.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:44]** Alive, whole, piece, car yard, 500 per scratches out.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:45]** Whole piece.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:48]** I mean, he was like trying to rack it up.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:50]** Like, oh, we're going to cut off each knuckle.

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:50]** Yes.

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:52]** That's 500, 500, 500.

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:54]** We can milk that for years, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:54]** Right.

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:55]** Yeah.

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:57]** True pirate is what he is.

**[00:14:57 - 00:15:04]** Um, so you guys kind of agreed, but you, but like I said, you, you let her know, um, don't true.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:05]** Lou is your true target.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:10]** And she was like, well, if you can help me out here, then maybe I can help you find a way to draw.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:10]** Don't true.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:11]** Lou out.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:12]** Cause riddles never seen.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:14]** Don't true.


## Speaker_0

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:14]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:24]** So you guys head to the car yards, and on the way, the car yards, you run into the same Hilkies that you fought last time.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:25]** Fools!

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:26]** Absolute fools.

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:29]** But they brought an extra Yosuke with them this time.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:31]** And so we roll back into combat.

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:32]** And so we'll take you back to the map.

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:36]** And the combat that had happened so far is there was, of course, a confrontation.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:42]** But now one Hilki is up close to the four of you.

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:45]** And then the other Hilki is kind of still back behind.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:49]** And then you have two Yusokis hiding behind cars and taking pot shots.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:58]** And what happened last, that you guys finished your turns, and now it is time for the Yosokis to take their shots.

**[00:15:58 - 00:15:59]** Love it.

**[00:15:59 - 00:15:59]** Are you all ready for this?

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:02]** Are you ready for this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:03]** Well, the one Yoki already took a shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:09]** One Yoki swung and smacked Rolu dead in the face for full damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:13]** I'm not going to be intimidated by your threats.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:14]** That was a standard action.

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:18]** I think you now lose the ability to roll for the other NPCs, and it's the top of the second round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:21]** You're not the GM and that's not how this works.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:23]** I'm GMing your life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:25]** Know your role.

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:26]** Both.

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:27]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:29]** You're not my real dad.

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:31]** R-O-L-E and roll R-O-L-L.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:32]** Have them go, Kev.

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:33]** I want to know what happens.

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:35]** Yeah.

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:37]** So the first Hilkey is going to take a shot.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:38]** Which one's that?

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:39]** Which one's first Hilkey?

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:41]** the closest one to you guys.

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:44]** So just for the listeners, we're going to take a shot with a ranged weapon.

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:45]** Yeah.

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:51]** What is the range on your, so last week you summoned a, an earth elemental.

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:52]** What is the range on earth elemental creature?

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:57]** Uh, it is a tiny creature, which means it takes a quarter.

**[00:16:57 - 00:17:01]** So then it has to be actually, so it shouldn't even be able to attack the Hilkey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:03]** That's last time.

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:05]** It can still attack, even with a reach of zero.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:09]** Yeah, but the reach of zero means you have to be physically contacting.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:17]** So, like, if the Yusuke that it is half a square away is no longer in contact, there's no risk of attack of opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:18]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:19]** Plus, it's burrowed.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:21]** So, I'm not sure where you're going, Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:23]** I don't think there's any chance of ARO for the Yusuke.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:25]** You're trying to say that I could be... Yeah, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:26]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:26]** Okay.

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:27]** All right.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:31]** So, the first Yusuke is going to take a shot at...

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:32]** Treme.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:34]** I feel like Treme has cover.

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:36]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:39]** Man, there's arguably cover every time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:41]** Well, don't put so many cars on your maps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:42]** It would be soft cover.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:44]** Or, sorry, partial cover.

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:45]** What would it be?

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:48]** Sorry, what was the definition of partial cover?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:55]** Partial is if more than half of you is visible, your bonuses from cover are plus two to AC and plus one to reflect saving throws.

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:58]** I actually... It's kind of a toss-up.

**[00:17:58 - 00:18:00]** I think it's a... I raised my eyebrows.

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:04]** It's kind of a toss-up between regular cover and partial cover.

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:05]** Wait, what?


## Speaker_0

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:05]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:06]** Yeah.

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:12]** Because I think you're standing right in front of the car.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:14]** And I'm on the back corner of it.

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:19]** I mean, if you wanted to get really technical, I'm behind three posts on the car.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:26]** Jeff sent through a really good diagram that was like how much of your body is showing on Discord.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:28]** And I was going to try and find that real quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:29]** Where is that?

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:34]** Because there's like two corners that you can see me from two of your corners.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:37]** So to determine whether or not your target has cover from an attack.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:44]** So if I pick a corner from my square, which would be, let's see, how do I draw?

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:46]** Kev, can you see this?

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:48]** Oh, yeah, yeah, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:52]** Yeah, so I'm saying it's a toss-up between whether it's more or less than 50%.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:56]** So we're talking about whether or not this car causes cover.

**[00:18:56 - 00:19:00]** So it says to determine whether your target has cover from you.

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:14]** If any line from this corner to any corner of the target passes through a square or border that blocks line of effect or provides cover or through a square occupied by a creature, the target has cover.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:16]** It doesn't pass through a border.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:17]** It passes along a border.

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:18]** Vinny, can I get some backup?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:21]** I feel like you're the... Rules as written.

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:29]** And this is really going to be where Kev makes his stand, whether we're going to be raw or medium rare or medium well.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:33]** And I think this is going to be the standard that we're going to have to hold him to for the rest of the game.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:39]** Like rules as written, that corner to Termadin's corner is uninhibited.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:39 - 00:20:04]** yeah these far corners sure i mean technically the car is in the squares but we're starting to split here the thing is like this is going to come up a million times and we always argue about it so like we need to just clarify what is what well but there's no clarification here this is where it's a gray area right the final clarification is what you rule because you're the gm i'll give you partial cover which is plus two okay partial cover it is partial cover good let's go so you have plus two to your ac

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:29]** will and i rolled or yes that's why i went behind this car what'd you roll nine miss that's a miss all right uh and so he is then going to move finally a bad roll from kev this is yeah crazy he's actually going to move back behind that junk like

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:56]** cow he runs for real cover because you guys are gonna argue it constantly i thought that you said that that thing was nothing you said that was just junk that's junk yeah i said it's junk i didn't say it was nothing okay i'll i'll say man this is this map is so like thaddeus has a clear line of shot at the um the hoki but not at the yusuke now right that makes sense because there's a big van in between them and a pile of junk that's presumably about as high as a small creature

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:57]** All right.

**[00:20:57 - 00:21:03]** The other Yusuke is going to actually take a step out and fire around.

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:08]** Man, that's a six.

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:11]** What's he firing with?

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:12]** Tactical semi-auto.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:14]** I think the range on that is 30 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:15]** Son of a bitch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:16]** Yeah, bud.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:17]** Yeah.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:19]** Oh, my God.

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:20]** All right, fine.

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:21]** He's going to move up and take a shot.

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:21]** Is that better?

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:24]** Welcome to Starfinder.

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:24]** That's much better.

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:24]** How far?

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:26]** Right there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:26]** That's range.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:28]** Fine.

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:30]** The Yosuke is going to step forward.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:31]** Take a shot at me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:40]** I'm sorry for keeping you to the range of... I'm for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:44]** Like I said, I have a million things to think of and the range on my pistols was not one of them.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:49]** And so that is a 10 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:50]** Miss.

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:53]** Dude, Tormadin.

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:54]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:55]** That's the end of their turns.

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:58]** The second Helki is going to run up.

**[00:21:58 - 00:21:58]** Try it.

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:00]** Just try it.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:04]** To here and take a shot at the elemental.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:06]** Unfortunately, though, it doesn't get flanking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:08]** He's underground, though, I thought.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:10]** The elemental.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:10]** Oh, you're right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:11]** It is.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:13]** Burrowed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:19]** I don't know if that actually does anything, though, mechanically, other than I can pass through objects.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:24]** I don't know if it actually, I don't think it protects me from, unless it's like fire or something like that.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:25]** That's weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:26]** I feel like it would.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:30]** I would expect to have burrowed into the ground would project you from.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:31]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:33]** You wouldn't be a target.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:35]** All right, so the Hilkey's fine.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:38]** The Hilkey's going to run up around the car right up in your face, Jermaine.

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:40]** And I just checked it, if you guys want to double check.

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:41]** So aggressive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:43]** Do I get an AOL?

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:44]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:45]** No.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:50]** And then he's going to swing his baton.

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:51]** That's a 19 on the dice.

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:52]** Hits?

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:53]** Of course it hits.

**[00:22:54 - 00:23:00]** And that's going to be 1d4 plus 3 of damage.

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:03]** 1d4 plus 3 damage.


## Speaker_0

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:03]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:07]** Dang, that's a four on the dice for seven points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:07]** Ridiculous.

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:09]** On Kevin.

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:09]** D-Riculous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:11]** D-Riculous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:12]** All right, I'm into hit points.

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:15]** Yeah, I'm also into hit points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:17]** So now you got both Hilkies are right up in front of you.

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:20]** The three of you are kind of cornered between two cars.

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:24]** And then Thaddeus is off to the side.

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:26]** Who wrote cover everywhere?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:26]** Me.

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:32]** So it's very clear what is cover and what is not.

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:35]** Actually, I do this when I'm GMing too, but I just put it on the GM layer.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:36]** So that way I don't forget.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:37]** All right.

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:39]** And that is the end of round one.

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:40]** Dang.

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:41]** What a round.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:42]** I know.

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:43]** And now we're back at the top of the round with Roland.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:53]** Okay, I think Ralu is seeing what's happening, seeing that these two Hilkies are coming up, is going to say, we need to play it smart and draw them in.

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:55]** I'm right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:57]** He says the Hilkie closest to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:57 - 00:24:00]** Yeah, he's going to take a five foot step back and check.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:04]** I guess you would come in a guarded step back behind the car.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:05]** Yeah, check.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:06]** Are you staying with them or jumping off?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:11]** Do you have a choice when it's not your turn?

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:13]** I mean, I want you to do what you want to do, but

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:37]** yeah that's a good i'm gonna come with you anyway all right what is this sidewalk made of sidewalk stuff dirt dirt yeah it looks like it's a sidewalk packed dirt okay it's concrete covered in dirt um okay how many hit points are you at turn right in you like pretty deep into your hit points


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:37]** Yeah.

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:40]** I mean, I just got hit max damage.

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:42]** I got seven, so I probably couldn't hit.

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:48]** I probably couldn't take another one of Kev's baton strikes if he rolled well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:58]** Well, Rolu is trying to keep some strategy here, because Rolu's also into hit points, and I don't know that I can get hit again without going down.

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:04]** So I think Rolu's going to say to Jack, like,

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:06]** If you can help out with any healing, that would be great.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:11]** And Rolu's going to cast Blessings of Youth on Tormeadin.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:19]** And going to take... Because one set of arms is holding the gun and the other's holding the spear.

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:26]** So I think you see a channel of light just come out of what would be Rolu's face.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:29]** And then kind of mist over onto you.

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:32]** And you are going to get...

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:39]** It's going to be, I think it's a... Yeah, first level.

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:42]** You're going to get some stamina points back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:45]** Full stamina points on the roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:48]** That's eight stamina points to Tormeiden.

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:50]** Because you were doing some good damage.

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:52]** I want you to be able to stay up.

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:54]** And that's my turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:54 - 00:26:00]** Wait, you also get a plus five foot enhancement bonus to your land speed for one round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:01]** Oh, yes, you do.

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:02]** Thank you.

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:03]** Rad.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:03]** Nice.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:04]** That's nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:04]** Look at that.

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:09]** Kev having some... Is that sympathy I detect, Kev?

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:10]** It's integrity.

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:11]** It's called weakness.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:14]** Is that weakness in your jam?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:19]** You lost your integrity when you tried to say we had no cover behind the car.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:21]** I think it's still debatable.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:22]** Moving on.

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:23]** Is that your turn?

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:24]** That's my turn.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:25]** Your whole turn.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:26]** All right.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:28]** Thaddeus, it's now your up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:33]** So on the cover question, he has partial cover or no, is that like dead ahead pretty much?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:34]** Oh, this guy's dead next round.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:34]** Don't worry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:39]** That's what I'm talking about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:41]** That helps answer my question.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:43]** Shoot this guy.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:45]** But curious though, this is cover or no?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:49]** I would say that is partial cover.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:56]** Because you pick a corner and if you have to intersect any borders...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:56 - 00:27:23]** do we do we john daddy is just is not able to like like shoot this guy so he misses unfortunately it like careens off the cover behind him oh damn dart okay like clinks to the ground dang okay oh yeah he's gonna move wait wait you can do a full attack you should do a full attack and attack twice with a minus four but kev it depends on if you want to let him do that now that he's fired once


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:28]** Yeah, I think that's something you definitely have to declare beforehand, but I'll allow it this one time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:29]** So don't forget, full attack.

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:30]** Full attack.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:34]** But it's a minus four, so you definitely missed the first one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:35]** Minus four to hit.

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:36]** And you're likely to miss the next one.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:39]** Wait, minus four to hit, not damage, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:40]** Correct.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:41]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:42]** Yeah, it's just two attacks at minus four.

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:44]** Well, that would work.

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:49]** Statistically, you have another chance to get a crit, so I think you should do it.

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:49]** So I rolled a 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:53]** It's a minus four, and there's a plus two for AC, for his AC.

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:55]** So it's a minus six, technically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:55]** What'd you get, Kelly?

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:58]** Okay, so I got 22, so minus four is 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:00]** AKC, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:02]** What's that?


## Speaker_0

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:02]** Did I hit it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:06]** Does an 18 hit with a thing having a stupid plus two?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:09]** It looks like it hits Kevin's face.

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:11]** Yeah, I think that's a hit face.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:12]** Kevin just wants to kill us all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:14]** Yes, that's what I'm talking about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:15]** Thank you for the full action.

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:17]** I didn't know I could do that with ranged attacks.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:17]** Dude, yeah, dude.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:18]** That's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:23]** Don't forget, make sure you read your actions on page... This is just for all of our listeners.

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:25]** Starting on page 244.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:28]** I thought that was only magic missile and ****.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:29]** Nope.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:32]** Magic missile gives you an extra missile if you do a full attack.

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:34]** I wish I had magic missile right now.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:36]** So that's... Oh.

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:38]** Yes.

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:41]** So that's six damage.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:42]** Yes.

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:44]** Plus you get poisoned.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:46]** You're on the poison track now.


## Speaker_0

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:47]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:50]** Actually, I have to roll a saving throw in order to see if I get poisoned.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:51]** Oh, fair enough.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:53]** What is the DC for that?

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:58]** The DC for that is... What poison are you using?

**[00:28:59 - 00:28:59]** Dex.

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:02]** Well, it's the turbo cannon.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:04]** Yeah, turbo carinine or something.

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:06]** Turbo carinine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:08]** It's DC 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:10]** Yeah, there you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:15]** Oh, and that hits him because I rolled a two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:16]** Yes.

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:17]** Yes.

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:19]** You are now sluggish.

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:20]** Sluggish.

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:26]** Is it sluggish or is it sluggish to stiffen to stagger to immobile?

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:29]** Okay.

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:29]** You're right.

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:29]** Sluggish.

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:31]** Sluggish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:36]** Man, things are heating up on the mean streets of Kifak Depot right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:39]** Poison name to say.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:40]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:43]** I know it is.

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:45]** And is DC 14 minus 10.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:49]** So on he takes a four four points of damage from that.

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:52]** So you did how many points damage six.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:53]** You did six.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:55]** So he takes a total of 10 damage.

**[00:29:56 - 00:30:18]** is he down because he's already he he's got to be like nine plus ten nineteen points total how many hp is whatever 500 this is a boss battle yeah maybe this is stage two of the battle wait sorry i'm i'm getting these mixed up so six minus two so that's that's yeah he actually is down


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:20]** Yes.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:21]** Yes.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:23]** Thaddeus is taking a shot from across the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:25]** Revenge for Thaddeus.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:27]** Wait, was this one of the guys that we fought last time?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:28]** Yeah.

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:30]** Yeah, that's the one that had the bandages on his hands.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:31]** All right, cool.

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:32]** That is right.

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:34]** He takes the dart in one leg.

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:35]** Yeah.

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:37]** And he goes, ah!

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:40]** And then he points to his other leg and goes, ah!

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:41]** What?

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:44]** And then he points back to the first leg and goes, ah!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:45]** It's like a video game NPC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:46]** Yeah.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:49]** Actually, Ace Ventura 2 reference.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:51]** Oh, okay.

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:55]** He falls back with his arms fully extended and just lays out in a starfish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:58]** Does he just glitch and he's just floating?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:58 - 00:31:01]** He's just... It's like Bethesda assets.

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:03]** I love that.

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:07]** Bethesda should do the physics for this particular game.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:11]** Then the cover question will truly be random every time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:15]** So now the Elemental gets a minus two to attacks on the dead body.


## Speaker_0

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:16]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:17]** Because he's floating.

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:20]** Oh my god, keep up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:21]** That's fine.

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:24]** He just floats into a car and no clips out of existence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:46]** yeah amazing all right well uh it was his turn and he's gone yes yay you're done so it's now termay's turn all right so termay is uh gonna gonna do an attack a melee attack against our uh friend in front of him yes beautiful


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:56]** And I believe because I'm using a battle staff, then I get the block if I successfully strike my target.

**[00:31:57 - 00:31:57]** Yes.

**[00:31:58 - 00:31:59]** Yes, you do.

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:01]** That is an 18 to hit.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:02]** That definitely hits.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:04]** Yeah.

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:05]** So I have that.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:06]** And then...

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:08]** I'm going to roll for damage.

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:10]** Freaking max damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:11]** Freaking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:13]** So satisfying.

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:13]** Four.

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:16]** Four points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:17]** Dude, awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:19]** That is what we need.

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:26]** And now the elemental is going to move through this cover burrowing under the earth.

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:27]** Oh, nice.

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:31]** And pop up right behind him.

**[00:32:55 - 00:33:00]** Plus two, plus one, plus my normal melee attack bonus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:01]** This guy's starting.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:02]** You got a minus two.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:03]** I'm just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:04]** Go ahead.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:06]** He's got serious hops for a six-second hang time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:07]** So it's plus two, yeah.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:10]** And then plus two, plus one, yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:11]** Does a 19 hit?

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:11]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:14]** It definitely hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:15]** No, it doesn't hit.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:16]** It definitely hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:20]** Thanks, Jeff.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:24]** So this is, I don't get any bonus to damage for flanking, right?

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:25]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:29]** No, but you do get the plus one from being tapped to go underground.


## Speaker_0

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:29]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:30]** Okay.

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:31]** Okay.

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:35]** Not max damage this time or not close to max damage.

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:36]** Seven points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:37]** Nice.

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:37]** All right.

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:38]** Still great.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:39]** Oh, that's great.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:41]** I feel like that might ice him.

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:41]** Slam.

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:43]** After that last damage you took.

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:44]** Are we right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:47]** Slamming.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:48]** Does he grow down?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:49]** Slam.

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:53]** Just all this earth just seems to just build up and then just cover this dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:55]** Plus he's like the shock helps kill him maybe.

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:56]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:57]** That amazing moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:58 - 00:34:00]** Actually, he's still up.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:00]** Really?

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:02]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:02]** A douche.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:04]** Is he looking okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:06]** You'd have to roll perception check on your next turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:09]** No, you roll perception check, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:14]** I rolled a natural 20, and I can see that you guys are all a bunch of idiots.

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:15]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:16]** That's really mean.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:18]** That's the end of your turn to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:19]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:20]** Good job.

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:22]** That was actually a really, really good move.

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:24]** Chuck, it is your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:45]** um chalks uh rifle uh i'm actually going to describe it for a minute it's sort of like it looks like an air rifle complete with like the orange tip on it so that nobody suspects that it's actually a real oh my god amazing he levels it at the hill key in front of term a yes and pulls the trigger


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:50]** Just for the listener, he's... So it's... It's... They are... The Earth Elemental.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:52]** Then you have the Hilki.

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:53]** And then you have Treme.

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:56]** And then you have Rolu with Chak on his shoulder.

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:56]** So... Yes.

**[00:34:57 - 00:35:00]** They are one square away and do not incur an attack about you.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:01]** Nope.


## Speaker_0

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:01]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:02]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:04]** Let's see.

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:06]** That's a 20 to hit.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:07]** Yes.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:08]** Yes.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:11]** It's a dirty 20, but it's a 20.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:11]** Oh, okay.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:12]** It's a dirty 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:13]** Thank you for that.

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:14]** It's a good specification.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:17]** Kapow.

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:18]** Right in the kisser.

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:19]** Max damage.

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:20]** Eight points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:21]** Yes.

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:22]** He's down.

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:22]** He's down.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:23]** Oh, wait.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:24]** No.

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:26]** This is a silky.

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:27]** This is the hilkey.

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:28]** Oh, it's the hilkey.


## Speaker_0

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:28]** Dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:29]** Has to be down.

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:30]** Come on, Hill King.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:34]** So you clip him right in the chin.

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:35]** Yes.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:37]** He buckles over backwards.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:38]** Gross.

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:41]** Shoulders hit the ground and he does not get back up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:42]** Yes.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:44]** Gross.

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:46]** You should call yourselves the false warriors.

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:49]** Ha ha ha ha ha.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:53]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:56]** I just thought of that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:56 - 00:36:03]** It's now... Wait, Chuck, you didn't move because you used your move action to stay on... There it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:08]** Yep, I'm just trying to figure out how to change my... There it is.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:10]** Yep, I'm good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:13]** So now it's the Yusoki's turn.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:15]** Both Yusoki's kind of go at the same time.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:17]** So it's the first Yusoki's turn.

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:22]** And that's the one that's further north on the screen.

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:22]** Yeah.

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:23]** He's no longer in cover.

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:26]** And he's going to just take a shot right at Treme.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:27]** Which one?

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:30]** For a natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:31]** Which one?

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:32]** Get out.

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:32]** Get out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:33]** Boo.

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:34]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:34]** No, this one.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:35]** I'm pinging this guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:38]** So doesn't he have to shoot?

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:41]** Don't I get something from my elemental?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:42]** Tiny elemental?

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:42]** No.

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:42]** No.

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:43]** It's a tiny creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:44]** 18 is just all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:45]** And the Hilki is down.

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:46]** Oh, I forgot.

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:46]** Hold on.

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:48]** Let me put this guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:49]** Yeah, I was waiting for you to take him out.

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:50]** Come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:52]** Sorry, it's just clicking.

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:52]** Oh, my God.

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:55]** Big X. Big X. Bam.

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:57]** Big old X. That is a natural 20.

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:59]** Why is nobody more excited for that?

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:01]** So that's a natural 20.

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:03]** And so I get to roll my dice twice.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:04]** And add your bonus twice.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:05]** And add my bonus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:09]** This is not the first crit on the show, on the pod.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:13]** I do have a block property, but I don't think it matters anymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:17]** Oh, you do get a plus one, but is it only from that enemy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:19]** I think it's only from melee attacks.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:21]** Yeah, I think you're right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:27]** We'll double check that because that's five and four for nine points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:28]** Nine points of damage.

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:34]** Good thing I gave you those stamina points or else you would have been out.

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:37]** Yeah, blocks from that target.

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:39]** So if that target had hit you, you would have had it.

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:41]** But it was a crit anyway.

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:41]** It's all good.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:43]** I'm still up.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:44]** Yeah, you are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:46]** And then the Yosuke moves back behind the car.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:48]** But you can't move, fire, then move.

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:49]** Yes, I can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:50]** I didn't move, fire, move.

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:52]** I fired, and now I'm moving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:54]** Oh, wow.

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:54]** Yeah.

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:55]** Fair enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:55]** Man.

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:57]** All right.

**[00:37:57 - 00:37:58]** Now it's the other Yosuke's turn.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:02]** This Yosuke is actually going to step out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:02]** Surrender?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:04]** No.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:05]** Guys, I give it up.

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:07]** We already discussed this.

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:10]** This is a clear path from here to here, right?

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:14]** Because I gave that to... Actually, I'll even step out further just to make sure it's obvious.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:17]** And he's going to take a shot at Thaddeus.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:19]** I rolled a 19.

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:20]** Does that hit?

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:21]** That's a miss, right, Thaddeus?

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:24]** Yeah, totally a miss.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:24]** Uh-huh.

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:25]** I'll even give you a partial cover.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:26]** Does a 17 hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:35]** But what Thaddeus is going to do is he's going to, before you fire, he's going to make sure that he has Breakaway Aegis activated.

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:36]** Or it's already activated.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:37]** I mean, it's already activated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:38]** Oh, fancy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:39]** Oh, yeah, that's right.

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:39]** Okay.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:40]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:40]** That's fair.

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:41]** That's fair.

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:41]** Smart.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:42]** Smart.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:42]** Smart.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:42]** Smart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:43]** Smart kitty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:47]** And that is four points of damage.

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:50]** So your Aegis breaks away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:54]** No damage received.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:54]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:55]** All right.

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:56]** Nice.

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:58]** It says I get negative five.

**[00:38:58 - 00:39:00]** Does that mean I get one extra HP now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:02]** No, that's not how that works.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:03]** All right.

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:04]** It breaks your Aegis.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:04]** It's done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:05]** Aegis is screwed for now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:07]** And that's the end of round two.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:08]** We're moving into round three.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:11]** Rolu, it's now your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:34]** oh oh oh wait no never mind it wasn't my turn go ahead it was not your turn uh i think i think the first thing rolu does is he's like well played lads just make sure to stay behind cover and he is going to can he how far can he move


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:35]** How far can I move?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:38]** I can move there.

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:39]** But I'm not.

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:43]** I don't have a lot of HP.

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:46]** I think he's going to.

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:48]** Kev, how much cover do I have from this junk?

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:49]** It's right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:50]** What are you talking?

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:51]** Zero cover currently.

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:53]** You're nowhere near that junk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:56]** I think the question you want to ask is where would you have to go to take cover?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:57]** Yes.

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:59]** Do I need to go here in order to get cover from it?

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:01]** Yes.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:01]** Okay.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:02]** So I'm going to move.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:05]** And I'm running down, sprinting.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:07]** Chalk, you coming with me?

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:08]** I guess you are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:10]** Oh, I'm along for the ride, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:11]** Okay, cool.

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:14]** Slides, does like a pitcher slide into home base behind it.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:19]** And... I'm assuming it's for flavor, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:20]** That was just for flavor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:22]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:25]** You know, it's like a quick slide.

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:28]** And then, can I... Is that 30 feet?

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:30]** Oh, it's 35 feet.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:31]** It's fine.

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:32]** As he's running...

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:40]** I think he looks over and I imagine in slow motion that Rulu's like seeing the Yosuke that's just out in the open.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:52]** And he kind of just like pictures for a second the Yosuke, like just like their skin starting to age and just like time around them, like moving really quickly.

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:56]** And so by the time that he gets to his spot, he's going to cast death.

**[00:40:56 - 00:41:17]** death's door and i just want to read the first thing it says you accelerate a living opponent's personal timeline to end to the end of their natural life cycle unleashing the ravages of time in a devastating surge i cast it last time and so i think you see a door behind like right in front of them kind of like

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:19]** move over the Yosuke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:22]** And it's a D10 of damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:28]** Yeah, it's a D10 plus two strength damage, but you make a fortitude saving throw, DC 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:30]** For fortitude savings?

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:31]** Fortitude.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:32]** Saving throw.

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:33]** Let me see.

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:36]** Yosokis have a plus 15.

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:38]** For fortitude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:39]** That's wild, man.

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:40]** That's good.

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:41]** Natural bonus, right?

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:44]** It's just like in the stat block.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:45]** What was it, DC?

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:47]** Guess.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:48]** No, it's 14.

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:49]** He misses.

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:56]** His skin just starts to, like, droop, and his eyes get dark and wrinkly.

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:57]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:00]** That's such a cool attack.

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:07]** I need to change my D10s because this one keeps rolling really low, but that's three points of damage, which sucks, but it's okay.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:08]** I'm going to change my D10.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:12]** But that is two points of strength damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:17]** Okay, so there's three points of regular damage and minus two to strength.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:23]** Minus two to strength, which would mean that any melee bonuses they have go down by one, as we talked about last time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:25]** Okay.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:26]** That's your turn.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:28]** That is Rulu's turn.

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:31]** And now it is Thaddeus' turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:36]** Thaddeus, like, shouts to the group, Remember, keep one alive.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:38]** We need to know where the troll is.

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:43]** And then he takes a shot at Mouseboy.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:45]** Which mouse boy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:46]** Mouse boy one or mouse boy two?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:48]** Mouse boy... Close mouse boy.

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:52]** And he's going to take a full action to do this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:55]** You see a light bulb appear above Jack's head.

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:59]** If none of them survive, none of them can share this information.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:03]** Our pursuit of Dotrolu remains... A secret.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:05]** Amazing.

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:08]** Okay, so that's basically the higher of those rolls...

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:09]** Does 14 hit?

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:10]** Say again?

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:11]** 14.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:11]** Does 14 hit?

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:13]** Wait, what was the higher of the rolls?

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:13]** 18.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:13]** 18.

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:16]** But it's a full action, so it's minus four for each roll, isn't that right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:18]** Oh.

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:20]** Yeah, but... Yeah.

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:23]** KAC is 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:24]** Yeah.

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:25]** All right.

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:25]** Nice.

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:28]** Time to roll for damage, kitty kitty.

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:30]** And it's five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:33]** Sorry, I'll edit that.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:34]** It's lower than 12.

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:35]** But you take five points of damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:39]** I give five points of damage to your gentleman mouse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:41]** Yeah, I take five points again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:42]** And then he's poisoned as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:44]** He's giving five points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:46]** Sir, here is your five points of damage.

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:47]** You must make a fortitude saving throw.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:48]** Oh, yes, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:51]** I just want to clarify that you're shooting another poison dart.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:53]** So you get six darts total unless you start buying more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:54]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:55]** That was kind of silly.

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:56]** It's your third dart.

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:58]** Well, I said I was going to do it, so I did it.

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:00]** Okay.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:01]** I did it, he says.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:07]** Well, and the poison dart takes DC minus 10 damage.

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:08]** What?

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:09]** that's how poison works.

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:19]** So normally when you, when you take a poison, when you ingest a poison, it takes, um, I forget the timeframe, but there's like an hour before it, and it actually starts implementing.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:25]** But when you shoot somebody with it, from my understanding of the book is that it implements immediately.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:25]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:31]** And with that, you take a DC minus 10 damage.

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:34]** And the DC is Kelly.

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:35]** What was the DC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:36]** The saving throw for poison?

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:40]** It's a 14 fortitude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:43]** Okay, so I have to roll a 14, otherwise I get poisoned.

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:46]** So let me roll that 14.

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:48]** It's a fortitude save?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:49]** Yes.

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:52]** So basically you would get four extra damage, I guess, right?

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:53]** If this hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:54]** And I definitely take that.

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:57]** So that's nine points of damage in total?

**[00:44:58 - 00:45:01]** Yeah, so let's just keep it separate.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:02]** How much was the original damage?

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:03]** Five.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:07]** Five, and then four points from the damage, because it's 14 minus 10.

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:07]** Yes.

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:16]** And so this Yosuke gets hit in the chest, and he looks down, and he's just almost, like, in shock.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:19]** Because, like, yeah, that hurt, and it penetrated.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:25]** And then he just feels this surge, and his skin starts to crawl, and he gets dizzy.

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:30]** And he trips backwards and falls flat to the ground.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:30]** Yes.

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:32]** And doesn't get up.


## Speaker_0

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:32]** Dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:35]** We'll see you next round.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:37]** JK, no, he's down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:44]** Okay, I was like, you're gonna just not, you're gonna let us wait until we find out if he's dead or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:48]** So now it is, it's Grego's turn, the Hilki, and he gets up from the ground.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:49]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:49]** What?

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:50]** He's dead.

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:52]** Moving on, Torme, Torme, is your turn?

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:53]** It's the Quantum Troll's turn.

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:54]** Just for the listeners.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:56]** These guys are kicking butt.

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:59]** Three out of the four enemies are down with little damage to them.

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:00]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:02]** You love a good comeback story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:07]** So there's one last Yusoki hiding behind a far car.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:10]** And it is Torme's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:12]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:13]** What does Torme then do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:18]** Torme is going to come up to the car.

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:19]** Well...

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:26]** I think Tormadin's just going to use a full action and cast magic missile against this guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:26]** Oh my god.

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:27]** I love it.

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:38]** I was waiting to see if Tormadin is going to just blow them out of the water or if he's just going to apply any type of mercy and I like it.

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:39]** You're just going to do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:41]** I'm just going to end your life.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:45]** So that's three magic missiles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:48]** Something tells me restraint is not in Tormadin's vocabulary.


## Speaker_0

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:50]** Ha ha ha ha ha.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:52]** So these automatically hit.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:53]** Yeah.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:54]** And what do you roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:54]** Okay.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:55]** That's one four.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:58]** That's another four.

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:00]** Amazing.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:01]** Come on.

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:03]** Another four?

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:07]** So that's 15 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:10]** And that automatically hits.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:10]** Automatically hits.

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:12]** 15 points?

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:14]** Oh, because it's a D4 plus one?

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:15]** Yes.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:16]** Yeah.

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:22]** So this last Yusoki, he's standing there and he just watched all three of his friends fall.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:30]** and he tries to hide underneath the car, but these magic missiles kind of fly one along the side of the car.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:31]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:35]** And it clips him in the side, and the other one flies along the other side of the car and clips him in the side.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:40]** And he kind of falls back a little bit, and the last one just smacks him dead in the chest.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:46]** And he actually falls back three feet and hits the ground and does not get back up.

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:47]** Oh, my gosh.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:50]** And we're out of combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:52]** Can I go listen to see if his dying words were like,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:54 - 00:48:01]** My 401k was just about to vest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:04]** What's the Starfinder skill for listening to dead thoughts?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:07]** Speak with dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:08]** Yeah, do you have that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:13]** What are your account numbers for your retirement?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:18]** Tell us two truths and a lie.

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:19]** Okay, so, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:20]** They're down.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:21]** They are all down.

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:22]** They are all down.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:22]** Thaddeus.

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:23]** Mission accomplished.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:25]** You can't ask any questions, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:27]** Thaddeus is going to, like, shout to Treme.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:31]** Treme, I said keep him alive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:32]** Oh, wow.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:35]** A little bit of internal conflict here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:41]** He brought me down to nearly death, so he deserves such treatment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:44]** Thaddeus is pretty pissed.

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:46]** He's not going to talk to Treme right now.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:48]** I'm going to search his body.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:49]** Silent treatment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:53]** Yeah, Brolu's going to come up and start searching bodies too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:57]** I guess Jack will search this one.

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:57]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:58 - 00:48:59]** What do we find, Kif?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:04]** So you guys, each Yosuke has a survival knife.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:05]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:08]** And a tactical semi-auto pistol.

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:09]** One second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:33]** uh there's nine rounds of of i mean they have a baton too presumably these uh humans right no i said that you're so are they tiny survival knives and tiny pistols uh no i don't think so do you need to have them tiny because you're i think they're like they're supposed to be miniaturized because because they're small creatures are small not tiny okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:36]** We can try and find a way to get you something.

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:36]** So they're normal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:39]** They also are both wearing flight suit station wear.

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:40]** Okay.

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:41]** Flight suit station wear.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:42]** Okay, so that's the Ahsokis.

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:46]** The two Hilkis, on the other hand, they're the ones with the batons.

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:50]** So they have Estex suits.

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:52]** Estex?

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:52]** Yeah, okay.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:55]** S-Tex with an X. Yeah.

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:56]** Suit 1.

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:57]** Yeah.

**[00:49:57 - 00:50:01]** And then they have a Polecaster pistol with one battery.

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:02]** Okay.

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:03]** Sorry, Pulsecaster.

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:04]** Pulsecaster pistol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:04]** Pulsecaster pistol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:09]** With one battery, 20 charges, and then there's a tactical baton.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:11]** So both of those things are times two, because there's two each.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:13]** Tactical baton.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:17]** And then you actually find one healing serum.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:17]** Ooh.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:18]** Marked up.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:20]** A Mark I, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:20]** Mark I?

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:22]** Yes.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:23]** Shaq, you should pick that up.

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:30]** Can I... Can Rollo do a perception check just to see more... Or maybe a culture?

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:33]** Just to see more, like, what...

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:39]** was there anything on them besides true warriors that they might've had any like markings or anything on their body?

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:42]** So not, so not culture, but like perception maybe or investigation.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:43]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:45]** What, what more are you looking for?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:52]** Just trying to see if there was anything else on their body that would tell me anything more about them besides stripping naked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:56]** No, I mean, I'm just looking, I'm going to strip this Yosuke naked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:57 - 00:51:02]** Um, one of them has a Yala tattooed across their wrist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:04]** A Yala, one of the Yosuke's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:06]** No, one of the Hilkies.

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:07]** Okay.

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:12]** One of the Yusokis actually has two teardrops tattooed underneath their eye.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:14]** Done some time, huh?

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:16]** The same one that had the... Oh, that was the Yusoki.

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:18]** Yeah, that was the Yusoki.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:31]** And actually, if you want to start stripping these guys down, they have lots of tattoos that are probably symbolic to being involved in the true working life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:34]** Thaddeus will strip this Hilki right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:34 - 00:52:04]** then strip them naked throw them up and on the street put them on a pike yeah i don't think we need to take such a it's pretty dark heavy-handed measure tornadoes but uh zero we should i think the sooner that uh that they are off the street and no one knows this happened then that will buy us some time with the true warriors i have to agree with your car also in true fashion for our crew make sure we distribute these as needed the items that we found savvy

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:06]** Yeah, we can talk about that.

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:07]** I can keep a ledger.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:08]** Good, good.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:11]** So Thaddeus will strip the silky.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:12]** What kind of tattoos does he see?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:16]** Yeah, is there anything with the tattoos that we should investigate further?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:19]** I would say you recognize a couple of tattoos.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:23]** Clearly one of them has true warriors across each part of his chest.

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:23]** True warriors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:25]** God, these guys are silly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:25]** True warriors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:27]** We are the true warriors.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:28]** So stupid.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:29]** True warriors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:38]** And then there's one of them that has Morrow kind of carved across their back.

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:41]** Carved.

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:49]** All of them have in some form or fashion a TW or a skull with a banner kind of like wrapped around the skull.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:50]** Yep.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:53]** A map, perhaps, to a secret hideout?

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:54]** Anything like that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:56]** Yeah, they have a map.

**[00:52:56 - 00:53:00]** One of them across his whole stomach is a big map in the middle.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:00]** Oh, great.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:06]** It's Akiton, and it shows Kefauk Depot, and there's numbers all over it.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:08]** Does it say, like, you are here somewhere on it?

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:10]** The number nine says, don't truly hide here.

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:11]** Don't tell anybody.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:13]** Is there, like, Google Maps, like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:38]** favorite places is that so kevin i'll have to like check the map later but number nine all right uh yeah is there like some i mean i is there some garbage or some dumpster that we can just hide the bodies for now because there's not really you see four cars and that pile of junk are these cars like abandoned or are they somebody's like daily driver that's what i was gonna ask


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:38 - 00:54:04]** uh i would say that they they look like they've been recently used like this is a city street this is a this is a normally busy street and it's it's like the true warriors were able to get everybody to leave uh if it was whether it's fear intimidation or whether it's just a you know mutual understanding but these cars are like people's daily drivers except for maybe that van looks okay so here's a question i mean one i think we tossed the bodies in the pile of crap


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:16]** uh yeah i think so too is there any way like here's what i'm trying to figure out i want to figure out if the lady that sent us to the car um car yachts to the car yachts

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:19]** was actually sending us... Do you think Riddle set you up?

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:24]** Not Riddle, but the lady at the junkyard that was sending us after.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:25]** That's Riddle.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:26]** That's Riddle?

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:27]** Yeah, that's Riddle.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:28]** Were you listening?

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:30]** I thought it was two separate characters.

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:33]** No, that's Riddle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:34]** Did I change my accent?

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:34]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:40]** Is there something I can roll to see if Riddle actually sent us into this ambush intentionally?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:44]** I would say if you were in the room with Riddle, you could have rolled since motive.


## Speaker_0

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:48]** Um, but you're no longer there.

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:52]** You could go back and confront her like, yo, what the, uh, that's up to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:58]** Take one of the ears off of one of the Yosokis with the survival knife.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:58 - 00:55:07]** It is curious that, Jack, you bring up a good point, that they seem to know our route, or at least where we might be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:12]** For all you know, Riddle is... Riddle is... Kevsh.

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:14]** Spoilers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:17]** Goodness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:18]** You're right, Tormadin.

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:18]** Yeah.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:22]** We all must keep our wits about us next time we are with Riddle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:24]** I don't know that I trust her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:30]** Thaddeus is going to, with y'all's permission, take 10 minutes to just rebuild his armor.

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:31]** Is he going to use it again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:35]** Yeah, I think... I'll take a 10-minute rest.

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:37]** Yeah, Broly's going to take a 10-minute rest, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:47]** I'll let you... If you want to take a 10-minute rest to regain stamina as well, I feel like rebuilding the breakaway Aegis is also a part of that relaxing time.


## Speaker_0

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:48]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:48 - 00:56:07]** I think as we're taking a 10-minute rest, Rolu's going to go over and crouch down next to Thaddeus, and he's going to say, Thaddeus, I know we don't see eye to eye on a lot of things, but this can't be your first time having someone disobey a direct order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:08]** Thaddeus... Is it?

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:12]** Thaddeus, like, actually doesn't answer that.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:21]** And he just kind of takes a... He takes, like, a good maybe, like, ten seconds, and he's just thinking as he's, like, putting these pieces back together for this breakaway armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:22]** And then... It's actually, like, made of Legos.

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:24]** So you're just kind of piecing them.

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:26]** It's kind of made of Legos.

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:28]** Yeah, he's like, click, click, click.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:28]** Yeah.

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:31]** But then, like, some, like, Duplo one shows up, and he's like, oh, no.

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:31]** Yeah.

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:34]** But that was the chink that broke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:35]** I can see you, like...

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:40]** I can see you, like, pausing for a sec as I talk to you, and then you just, like, keep going.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:46]** He pauses, he keeps going, and then he just looks at Rolu with, like, a knowing expression.

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:48]** His eyes, like, sort of half-lidded.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:57]** And then he's like, Rolu, when did you leave your last crew?

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:01]** When did I... When did you leave...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:06]** It's quite the transition there, Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:09]** I'm just so interested.

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:11]** Within the past year?

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:15]** Within the past year, mm-hmm.

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:22]** You and Hears... You were... You were kind of close, weren't you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:31]** As one can be when they're serving on another ship and in the senior chain of command, absolutely.

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:31]** Absolutely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:34]** You wouldn't say you left, you say the past year.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:36]** You wouldn't say you left in the last month or so.

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:37]** No?

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:38]** No.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:41]** I think year and month are two different words.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:42]** Where are you going with this, Thaddeus?

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:45]** I'm just curious, Rolly.

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:46]** You're an interesting man.

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:48]** I want to know more about you.

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:50]** I appreciate it.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:52]** It's important to know who you're working with on the day-to-day.

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:53]** You know what I'm saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:59]** It's good to get to know your coworkers, but maybe now is not the time.

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:02]** If there's another conversation that you want to have, then...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:25]** well just so it's been a year roly a year one full year yes perhaps it's yeah check check sensing the tension hops off and like has a seat on the car he's just leaves he's out he's like all right he just shrivels up a bucket of popcorn appears from somewhere


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:29]** I think Rolude... He grows his own popcorn.

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:39]** Rolude looks at him and says, yes, and then takes a part of the armor and connects it and then stands up to start to walk away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:41]** Roll an engineering check for that.

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:43]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:43]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:45]** I've got pretty good engineering.

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:47]** I start to walk away.

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:52]** I'm not trying to end the conversation, but if you wanted to say something else, because it seemed like you were about to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:57]** I'm trying to figure out how long my earth elemental gets to hang around.

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:00]** Sorry.

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:04]** Thaddeus just says, well, that's good to hear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:06]** Very good to hear.

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:15]** I'm sure that everything you said was perfectly true and there's nothing, no problem at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:16]** Thanks for the information.

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:21]** And he just, like, has repaired his army, puts the last piece in, and he stands up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:25]** You see Rollo about to say something, and then... No.

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:28]** Turns and... All right.

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:33]** Are we sufficiently ready to move on to the Kayads?

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:33]** Let's do this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:36]** Anyone want anything from this bag of loot?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:38]** Ready as I'll be.

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:43]** Again, sorry I dispersed our...

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:46]** Last remaining foe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:48]** Roller's going to look at Thaddeus.

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:55]** Just remember, in combat, when you're given a command, just listen to the chain of command.

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:57]** All right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:58 - 01:00:00]** Certainly, of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:02]** Right.

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:06]** And then he, like, leans back against the car, waiting.


## Speaker_0

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:07]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:32]** let's move so we're going what do you guys do so you uh like as that conversation was going on chak was facing the group but behind his back he was typing into the data pad with his tendrils do you want to tell us who he's typing he was relaying the the thaddeus's line of questioning to the captain hmm


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:57]** and that's our game and that's our game going back to Will's question summon creatures actually only one round per level and you're only level one so technically you shouldn't have gotten that second slam on me but we'll let that slide next week the car yards the car yards the car yards


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:58 - 01:01:01]** Thanks for listening, you scallywags.

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:06]** Until next week, drift beacons and distant stars.
