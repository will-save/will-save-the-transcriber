## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:00:01 - 00:00:12]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:14]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:15]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:16]** Get out.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:20]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:22]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:23 - 00:00:30]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales of the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:33]** Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:00:55 - 00:01:00]** Welcome back to Will Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:01:00 - 00:01:00]** I'm Kevin.

**[00:01:00 - 00:01:01]** This is Unknown Treasures.

**[00:01:01 - 00:01:05]** Just a reminder, we have Vinny, Kelly, John, and Will at the table.

**[00:01:06 - 00:01:10]** We have a cast of Will Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:10 - 00:01:14]** I was really hoping for a second that we'd all buy in and not sing anything, and it just sounded like Kevin was by himself on that episode.

**[00:01:15 - 00:01:17]** Also known as the Fab Five.

**[00:01:17 - 00:01:18]** Yes.

**[00:01:18 - 00:01:19]** Yeah.

**[00:01:20 - 00:01:20]** No tracks.

**[00:01:20 - 00:01:21]** Yep.

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:23]** Definitely.

**[00:01:23 - 00:01:24]** Definitely tracks.

**[00:01:25 - 00:01:26]** All right, I'm just going to say it right now.

**[00:01:26 - 00:01:28]** White pizza is f***ing great.

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:29]** Oh, man.

**[00:01:29 - 00:01:30]** Don't this again.

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:30]** Oh, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:31]** Not on this.

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:32]** Not Hill.

**[00:01:32 - 00:01:33]** Yeah, I will at you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:33 - 00:01:35]** Yeah, and you're going to be wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:35 - 00:01:38]** White sauces are trash.

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:39]** Thank you, Vinny.

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:40]** Give me tomato.

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:42]** Who eats white pizza anyway?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:43]** Me.

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:44]** John, apparently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:45]** It's tasty as hell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:49]** John, I don't even know how to disagree with you because I've never even had it, basically, because no one eats that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:53]** It's so far beneath Kelly that it has never graced his table.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:54]** Oh, my God.

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:56]** It's not even about the white sauce.

**[00:01:57 - 00:02:02]** Sometimes it's just a white pizza, meaning it's just olive oil and some cheese and some tasty garlic.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:04]** Where's the rest of my pizza, John?

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:05]** There's no sauce at all?

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:07]** I have a question, John.

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:09]** There doesn't have to be sauce.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:10]** John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:11]** Definition of a pizza.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:12]** I proffer.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:13]** Okay.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:16]** Tell me the difference between a pizza with no sauce and a quesadilla.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:48]** it's clearly a quesadilla folded in a tortilla a pizza is on a pie with dough come on bro I would say you have a case if there's like a calzone in the mix but anyways I wanted to ask does it have to have tomato or does it just have to be a non like olive oil sauce because I use sriracha as a basic sriracha is a red sauce


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:49]** I mean, it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:53]** I think that it is all non-tomato-based pizza.

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:55]** I love pizza that doesn't.

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:56]** Is it considered white sauce?

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:56]** Really?

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:57]** No, no, no, no.

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:58]** No, no, no.

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:00]** I didn't say that.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:01]** I didn't say it was not considered white sauce.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:05]** I'm just saying I love pizza that doesn't have tomato sauce.

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:06]** I also love tomato sauce pizza.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:07]** Don't get me wrong.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:07]** It's great.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:10]** That's like 90% of the pizzas out there.

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:14]** But sriracha, Alfredo, nothing, just olive oil.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:15]** No Alfredo.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:19]** I'm just against, I'm anti-white sauce on pizza.

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:24]** When I mean white sauce, I mean like the weird Alfredo chicken parm, whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:25]** I don't buy that either.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:27]** No, I know you don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:30]** I'm just saying that's my definition of quote white sauce.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:36]** And then like a plain pizza without sauce, that's different than, and I'm just not saying that's pizza either.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:39]** According to Oxford Dictionary.


## Speaker_0

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:39]** Whoa.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:47]** A dish of Italian origin consisting of flat, round base of dough baked with a topping of tomato sauce and cheese.

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:50]** So you have to have tomato sauce for it to be pizza.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:50]** Yeah.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:50]** According to Oxford.

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:52]** According to Oxford Dictionary.

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:53]** John, why are you better than me?

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:54]** They're the authority on the matter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:56]** We don't have to worry about them.

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:56]** Okay.

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:58]** We don't have to worry about what they say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:58 - 00:04:00]** There goes all our English listeners.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:03]** And by that, I'm getting married in the UK.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:03]** I love you.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:04]** You're fantastic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:06]** Fair point.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:09]** I don't think the British know food.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:14]** Oh, that's fair play.

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:15]** That is fair play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:17]** Also, to be said, how many of you are Italian?

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:19]** That's what I thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:26]** I think, okay, one, in 25 years, this is the closest we've come to throwing hands.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:32]** Actually, I can think of one other time, but it's not airworthy at all.

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:34]** No.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:34]** Okay.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:34]** Oh, man.

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:35]** Oh, man.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:39]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:40]** Yeah, no, that will stay off the air.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:44]** I'll secretly record it for you guys.

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:44]** Oh, brother.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:45]** Anyway.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:49]** Two, I think we have to revoke your Italian card.

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:49]** What the?

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:50]** Whoa.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:50]** Yeah.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:51]** Get out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:51]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:54]** You bored of non-Italians get to revoke my Italian card.

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:56]** Because it has to be a tomato sauce.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:56 - 00:05:02]** I'm going to call up my buddy from Rome and I'm going to be like, yo, does pizza have to have tomato sauce?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:05]** Look, it's just more ambrosia for me.

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:06]** It's f***ing tasty.

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:12]** And you all don't know how to expand your mind into a new definition of pizza.

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:16]** And I'll just be here in the brave new world with all of me and my wonderful friends.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:17]** Barbecue chicken pizza.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:18]** F***ing great.

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:20]** Barbecue chicken pizza?

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:22]** Yeah, tasty as f***.

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:22]** Love it.

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:23]** Again.

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:25]** Because barbecue sauce is tomato based.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:28]** Fair point.

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:32]** So have you just had a pizza with no sauce?

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:33]** Not necessarily Alfredo.

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:35]** Just like olive oil, like cheese.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:37]** Yes, I've had cheese sticks.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:39]** Yeah, I've had cheese sticks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:40]** They're not cheese sticks, man.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:41]** I've had cheesy bread.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:43]** I've had cheese bread with cheese on it.

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:49]** I've had to work in the dough because, you know, without the weight of the tomato sauce, you're free to make beautiful creations on your dough.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:52]** I'm just saying there's a lot there that I think you guys are really missing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:55]** Don is, like, grasping at straws with what defines a pizza.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:56 - 00:06:01]** Nah, man, I'm grasping at all the tomato sauce I'm trying to dump in the trash so I can just have my white pizza.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:05]** I don't even, this is not going to go over well.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:07]** I don't think you're going to find many allies.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:10]** I'm pretty sure most people listening are not going to be cool with this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:11]** Highly disagree.

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:17]** If I get at least, how many people do I need to agree with me that they like white or non-tomato pizza?

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:19]** Six.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:19]** Six?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:23]** We need six people on the Discord to back this opinion.

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:24]** It's not going to happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:25]** It won't happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:30]** We need an overwhelming amount of support for tomato sauce on pizza.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:31]** Oh, come on.

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:31]** Here we go.

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:31]** Here we go.

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:32]** Here we go.

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:33]** Here we go.

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:44]** If we can get six people to back John's opinion on the Discord, the next We'll Save Gathering, I will eat an entire white pizza.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:47]** Wait a second.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:50]** Honestly, that just sounds great.

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:51]** That's not a bad thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:52]** I'm fine to watch this.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:55]** I'm not fine to eat or participate in one.

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:57]** I don't have a horse in this.

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:58]** Just try it.

**[00:06:58 - 00:06:59]** Just try it.

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:00]** What kind of white pizza are we talking about?

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:03]** Are we talking like some weird Alfredo concoction?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:05]** I think John and I would have to agree on the pizza.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:09]** There's one white pizza that I've had that... Oh, s***.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:11]** Oh.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:11]** Oh, s***.

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:13]** Oh.

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:13]** Oh.

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:14]** Oh, no.

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:15]** You stopped yourself mid-sentence.

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:15]** Oh, no.

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:17]** You stopped yourself mid-sentence.

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:18]** I did.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:21]** There's one white pizza that I've had a slice of that I really enjoyed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:22]** See?

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:25]** But you didn't enjoy it as a pizza.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:27]** Was it like fire chokes or something?

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:30]** It was seafood and cheese on dough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:31]** Come on.

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:33]** That's just called stuff on dough.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:35]** That's like everything else is not a pizza.

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:37]** You can put anything on dough and make it a thing.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:39]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:43]** So if I roll a pan and put it in a piece of bread, is it hot dog?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:45]** You're not talking about pizza.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:48]** You're talking about cheese bread.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:50]** It's not cheese bread.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:51]** What is cheese bread?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:57]** It's not shaped or cut or baked at all like pizza.

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:57]** It's not at all.

**[00:07:58 - 00:08:03]** White pizza is still baked like pizza, but it's different because it just doesn't have all the weight of that tomato sauce in it.

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:05]** And you're free to do a lot of other stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:08]** And so the bread actually rises instead of being a pizza.

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:09]** So it's no longer a pizza.

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:11]** So whatever you say, it's no longer a pizza.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:13]** Some pizza bread rises.

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:14]** I don't know what you're talking about.

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:15]** It depends on if you want to think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:16]** Not because it's held down by the.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:19]** No, I'm just kidding.

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:19]** All right.

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:21]** Unless you're in Chicago.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:22]** We're going to talk about bread.

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:24]** One type of bowl of pizza.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:25]** Yeah.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:29]** My favorite deep dish, thick, bready pizzas.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:30]** We just had one tasty.

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:31]** I like it.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:31]** I like it.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:33]** Underground pizza company.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:36]** I was just in Korea and like the pizza bread there.

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:38]** All the pizza dough is like purple.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:40]** From at least all the stuff that I can remember.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:41]** I had it multiple times.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:42]** Is it from the bean?

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:44]** I think they have like some kind of bean in it.

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:45]** Yeah.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:47]** And it was actually the pizza in Korea.

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:51]** Korea, I was really surprised because I like, sorry, Japan, your pizza is like really bad.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:54]** But I expected Korea to be really good, bad.

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:56]** It's nothing like Japanese pizza.

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:58]** It's actually really good.

**[00:08:58 - 00:08:59]** So good job.

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:00]** There was like potatoes on it.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:01]** Sweet potatoes.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:03]** Potatoes on pizza.

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:04]** Can we talk about that?

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:04]** No.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:08]** Doesn't matter if it's like tomato sauce or cut bacon.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:09]** It was all kinds of good stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:12]** I don't know that I've ever had potato on pizza.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:14]** You're missing out on a potato pizza.

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:16]** There's a way to do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:23]** I'm going to dress up in Alfredo sauce and like scallop potatoes on your pizza, Vinny, at our next gathering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:26]** It doesn't need to be white or Alfredo sauce.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:28]** I'm just going to throw up in my mouth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:31]** And then we're all going to try it and be like, wow, this is really good.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:32]** We'll each try it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:36]** And then I'll be like, I'll be making my own chicken sriracha pizza.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:38]** Which is very tasty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:38]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:41]** And I love it because it's non-tomato pizza.

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:42]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:45]** I will suffer through it.

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:46]** I will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:48]** You said you don't want to eat it anymore.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:50]** Kevin, you can't have it.

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:51]** I didn't say that.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:52]** You can't have spicy things.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:54]** You said you can't have spicy things.

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:57]** Treme and myself love spicy things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:57 - 00:10:01]** But if it's something that I like, I would try it and suffer through it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:06]** I think it's going to be a function of how many bathrooms we have available.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:07]** True.

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:09]** Alright, moving on.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:11]** Who wants to play Starfinder?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:16]** Speaking of shit, let's play Starfinder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:17]** Yeah, let's play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:20]** Let's hop back into this battle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:24]** After I get over the battle for white pizza.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:26]** I have this big circular thing here.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:27]** It's not a white pizza.

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:28]** It's a windstorm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:29]** Seems like a white pizza.

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:30]** Yeah.

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:31]** And it has no sauce on it.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:33]** It might as well be a pizza that John made.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:34]** That's what I'm saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:37]** Everything's a pizza if it's round to John's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:37]** Yeah.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:39]** Cheeseburger, that's a pizza, right?

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:40]** Okay.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:42]** It's round and there's no tomato in it.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:42]** It's a pizza.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:43]** It's a pizza.

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:44]** No, no, no.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:45]** I mean, yeah.

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:46]** You know what?

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:52]** Look, if a hot dog is a taco, if a hot dog is a taco, then... Hot dog, not a taco.

**[00:10:54 - 00:11:01]** I will gladly live my life with a new branch of philosophy called everything's a pizza if it doesn't have tomato sauce.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:01]** Ism.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:05]** I expect this book by next year, John.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:09]** So last time, you continued the fight with the Grey and the Drift Phantom.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:12]** Starting with the Grey's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:16]** Sorry, that was a really delayed joke.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:17]** You don't have to release it.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:18]** It's cool.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:19]** So it's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:23]** At first I thought you were talking about how long it's going to take me to read my intro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:25]** Wait.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:28]** That was the proximal joke, too.

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:31]** How long it takes to finish a Starfinder book?

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:32]** Is that why we're taking forever?

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:34]** Oh, my God.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:36]** It's perfectly correlated to one-on-one relationship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:37]** That's so rude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:38]** I don't know if we should keep this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:41]** Kevin, how's whatever book you're reading right now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:46]** I'm still on, and by the time this episode comes out, I will still be on.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:52]** No, I'm about halfway through Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:55]** The restaurant at the end of the universe, right?

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:55]** How big is that book?

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:56]** I finished that one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:57]** I'm on the next chapter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:58 - 00:12:02]** So long and thanks for all the... Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:03]** I forget.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:04]** I'm not looking at it.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:08]** It's the ultimate, so it's like the... It's 208 pages.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:09]** It's not that big, Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:11]** No, I have the ultimate one that's like 1,000 pages.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:14]** It's all 12 books added together or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:15]** Anyways, we're playing Starfinder.

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:16]** Enough of that.

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:20]** So last time, you continue to fight with the Grey and the Drift Phantom.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:27]** Starting with the Grey's turn, Malziox used Black Hole to pull Chalk and Rolu toward her.

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:31]** Termay tried to kill her with another Adamantian shot.

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:34]** but accidentally summoned a windstorm from another dimension.

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:40]** The Phantom tried to attack Rolu, but critically failed and took flat-footed as well as something else.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:43]** But don't worry, we got that taken care of.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:46]** You all took advantage of this because he was flat-footed.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:48]** You were able to reposition yourselves.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:57]** The Grey then moved to the middle of the drift drive wreckage, but Tremei was able to take a shot at her, knocked her to the ground.

**[00:12:57 - 00:13:00]** You aren't done yet, though, because you're still fighting that drift phantom.

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:01]** Oh, and wait.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:04]** It's the gray's turn again.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:05]** Ugh.

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:07]** Dude.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:08]** Hate that.

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:09]** Woo.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:10]** I rolled a 23.

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:13]** Who has the highest intimidation?

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:15]** That's a good question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:18]** What's really funny is it might be Chalk.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:18]** Yeah, it could be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:22]** Yeah, I think because mine's charisma based, right?

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:23]** Oh, I have plus five.

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:25]** Plus five.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:27]** I ordinarily have a plus six.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:28]** What's Chuck's?

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:29]** What's Chuck's?

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:30]** Plus nine.

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:31]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:32]** Come on.

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:32]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:34]** No.

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:38]** Chuck has the biggest leaves out of anyone here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:44]** Well, I think the DC is supposed to be 15 plus one per person.

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:44]** So that's four of you.

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:46]** So it's already to 19.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:52]** And then your intubation check is a nine for a total of 28.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:54]** So I failed.

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:57]** But you hear it.

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:59]** It just doesn't affect you the same way.

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:05]** This telepathic pulse, you just hear a screech in each of your heads.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:11]** But you guys are so focused on just finishing this fight that you just shake it off and you're not shaken.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:18]** So she screeches and then she falls flat to the ground and she actually is dead.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:20]** Dead dead?

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:21]** Not going to come back?

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:22]** Dead dead.

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:24]** Wow.

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:25]** You're not going to make us roll a medicine check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:26]** Awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:27]** I'm not even going to make you.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:28]** I'm giving that to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:29]** Wow.

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:30]** Thank you, Kev.

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:32]** That is super kind of you.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:35]** You actually put the red X on roll 20, which means.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:38]** Is the pizza still here?

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:39]** Did it dissipate?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:40]** The pizza is still here.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:42]** Oh, thank you for reminding me.

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:49]** The pizza is going to be here for four D4 rounds according to the wonder chart.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:52]** So go ahead and roll those four D4s for us, Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:53]** Okay.

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:55]** The first one was a one.

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:56]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:57]** Count on my fingers.

**[00:14:58 - 00:14:58]** I can count it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:58 - 00:14:59]** Second one's a four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:01]** All right.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:02]** Five rounds there.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:03]** I'll hold up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:06]** Third one's a three appropriately.

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:08]** And a four.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:08]** The last one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:10]** Okay, I ran out of fingers.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:11]** That's 12 rounds?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:13]** Yeah.

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:15]** How many rounds?

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:16]** One, three, four, four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:19]** So we're already down one round.

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:21]** So we're at 11 rounds left of this windstorm.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:25]** Okay.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:25]** Okay.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:28]** Treme, it is your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:30]** Still very confused.

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:36]** He's going to walk over and be like, you know, I've been here for years.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:39]** Who are you again?

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:42]** You don't look familiar to me.

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:44]** I don't think you should be here.

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:47]** And he's going to walk towards the gray sort of position.

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:51]** So he's on the periphery of the cyclone.

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:56]** And, uh, towards next to the gray, he's going to kind of peer over at the body though.

**[00:15:56 - 00:16:05]** Uh, but, and then I don't know, maybe, maybe look at it real quick and make sure that it's dead or see if it's got any cool, uh,

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:15]** Is there anything that I could perceive in this dim light, given though that I have dark vision and I'm standing next to this gray's lifeless corpse?

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:22]** Do I see anything in his hands, clutches, or his person that would hurt her?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:23]** It's a female.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:25]** Yeah, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:27]** But go ahead and roll me perception.

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:29]** You're doing perception or medicine?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:30]** Perception.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:32]** Okay.

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:32]** Eighteen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:34]** An 18.

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:39]** You don't see anything in her hand or on her body.

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:44]** She does, I think, have an armor on.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:46]** I'd have to look that up.

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:50]** There's no weapons in her hands, no devices.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:53]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:56]** She's wearing a clear weave 1.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:57 - 00:17:01]** Any, like, you know, access card for the computer to turn off this phantom?

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:02]** No.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:02]** Got it.

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:04]** All right.

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:09]** So he's going to be like, well, that's when I started blasting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:13]** So wait, sorry, what is your ailments from that critical fail?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:15]** I have a charisma poison.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:17]** Yeah, you're two steps down the charisma poison track.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:18]** Okay, so you're not confused.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:23]** No, I'm just playing it up like I'm confused.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:27]** That's what my charisma does for me, I guess is what I'm saying.

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:28]** I don't know.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:30]** I'm just super awkward.

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:30]** How about that?

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:32]** Do you want me to just play super awkward?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:34]** I just want to make sure you didn't have the confused condition.

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:34]** That's all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:36]** No, I don't have that.

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:38]** I am not the president.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:42]** Because, like, your intelligence and wisdom are still intact.

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:43]** So, like, you can see what's going on.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:46]** You just can't communicate any of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:46]** Yeah.

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:48]** So, I started blasting.

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:51]** And I got a 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:55]** A 17 against?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:57 - 00:18:00]** This is a... What are you shooting?

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:03]** I'm shooting the Frostbite Class Zero.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:05]** Should be energy, so that would hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:35]** Coolio but like it only does damage I think I have to get like almost max damage for it to even go through which was 6 so it gets 1 point of damage I hate you it's alright there's just this left we're alright until it like spawns in a 2 or something yeah it does a nova explosion kills all of us instantly


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:38]** And that's my turn, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:40]** Oh, right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:42]** Repeat the line.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:48]** We're back at... We're at the top of the next round, so let me knock down the windstorm one so I don't forget.

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:49]** Remind me every time.

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:55]** Rolu, it is going to be your turn, but before we do that... Roll for light.

**[00:18:56 - 00:19:01]** I believe a five is going to be dark.

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:06]** So I need you and Chalk to put the blinded effect back on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:07]** Oh...

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:13]** And sorry, I don't have any concealment with blinded when it's dark.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:22]** I mean, I'm playing myself right now, but I would think that I probably would.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:24]** You're flat-footed.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:30]** You take a minus four penalty to most strength and dex-based skill checks and opposed perception checks.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:33]** You automatically fail perception checks based on sight.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:35]** Opponents have total concealment against you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:35]** There it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:38]** And you must succeed.

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:42]** You have a DC 10 acrobatics check to move more than half your speed, or you fall prone.

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:43]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:49]** So with total consummate, I can't even attack, although I can attack into a square I think it occupies.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:53]** And if it's successful, it has a 50% mischance.

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:57]** That is total consummate from an enemy.

**[00:19:58 - 00:19:58]** Okay.

**[00:19:58 - 00:19:59]** Cool.

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:04]** Well, I think that it has the space that's 10 feet in front of me.

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:10]** But Rolu is recovering from this piercing scream, right?

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:18]** of this gray and the not so wise part of him is curious about the gray, but he realizes he needs to put that curiosity away for now.

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:24]** And instead he's going to attack 10 feet in front of him with his asthma serpent laser.

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:25]** He's going to shoot.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:30]** And that first attack, it's going to be a nine.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:33]** It's gonna frigging mess.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:34]** Cause I don't think that that hits correct.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:35]** That does not.

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:36]** Okay, good.

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:38]** Cause the next one was a crit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:40]** So it's a crit, but you still have to do concealment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:41]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:44]** Okay, so you want to check and see who went first before you pull a card?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:48]** Muted excitement as we realize that I might lose this crit.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:49]** Let's find out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:51]** And it's a 50% miss chance?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:52]** 50% miss chance.

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:55]** So is it above or it's above that it hits?

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:57]** If it's below, I miss, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:58 - 00:20:58]** I'll agree to that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:00]** Are you f***ing kidding me?

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:01]** It's a 46.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:06]** It's a 40 f***ing 6.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:08]** That was a beautiful roll, though.

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:10]** It was a beautiful roll.

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:15]** There was a chorus of music that played all on my side so no one else could hear it.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:18]** All right, that's Rolu's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:22]** All right, it is now the Drift Phantom's turn.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:24]** What are they going to do?

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:27]** What are they going to do?

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:32]** I think they're just going to step up and keep slamming you.

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:35]** I think that's kind of its best mode.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:37]** Great if they didn't.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:52]** So this form of a purple, cloudy, sparking version of Treme just walks forward and thrusts its body and pounds into you with a...

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:56]** That's a 12 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:57]** Against KAC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:58 - 00:21:58]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:00]** Not going to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:01]** It would be against EAC, actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:02]** Still not going to hit.


## Speaker_0

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:03]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:04]** I think it's EAC.

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:05]** Let me double check.

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:06]** But yeah, not going to hit.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:07]** All right, that's the end of that turn.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:08]** Chuck, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:10]** Is that adjusted for blindness?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:11]** Why would it be adjusted?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:13]** Like, do I lose my AC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:15]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:17]** I don't have a penalty to my EAC, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:18]** Don't make me look this up again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:18]** I just looked it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:20]** I thought it was a minus four to AC, period.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:25]** I thought it was a minus four to all strength and dex-based skill checks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:36]** Flat-footed take a minus four penalty to strength and dex.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:38]** So whatever flat-footed, that'd be minus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:39]** Right?

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:43]** So most strength and dex-based skill checks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:49]** And a minus two from flat-footed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:50]** Ah, okay.

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:50]** Very true.

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:53]** Weird that it didn't correct that on here.

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:56]** So it was a 12 to my ESE?

**[00:22:57 - 00:22:57]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:22:57 - 00:22:57]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:58 - 00:22:58]** Okay.

**[00:22:58 - 00:23:04]** I think in Rolo's head he thought that he might have missed whatever shape was moving towards him, but instead you hit.

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:06]** Todd goes for the roller.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:08]** All right.

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:08]** Wow.

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:10]** I was going to do something else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:14]** Now is Rolo not totally concealed from the phantom?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:15]** No, the phantom has darkvision.

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:16]** Oh, I shouldn't have told you that.

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:16]** It's a secret.

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:18]** It can see you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:19]** Lawyered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:20]** Yeah.

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:20]** Lawyered.

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:28]** It is going to be an energy attack because slam has B and E, so it is partially an energy attack.

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:30]** So that hit.

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:35]** So I'm going to roll a D4 if I can find one.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:36]** Oh, it's over here.

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:36]** I found it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:37]** That's good.

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:38]** You don't want to find that the hard way.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:39]** I need you to roll a 1.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:41]** 10 points of damage.

**[00:23:41 - 00:24:11]** yeah that's a lot of damage a lot of damage for sure bludgeoning and electrical so with that either of those give you weakness of some sort what I'm just saying if you have a weakness to electrical or bludgeoning no I've never had that ever okay but Barolu does have a weakness to being hit beyond the total amount of hit points he has and he falls to the ground oh right yes yeah cool


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:12]** Roll is down.

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:13]** Fun times.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:14]** That's perfect.

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:16]** Perfect opportunity for something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:18]** Wait, what is the face on Chuck?

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:19]** What is that face?

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:20]** Cool, cool, cool.

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:20]** He's blinded.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:22]** Oh, okay.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:22]** That's why the eyes are closed.

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:24]** Okay, I see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:25]** I should do that, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:25]** Bam.

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:31]** So that is the Drift Phantom's turn.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:32]** Chuck, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:33]** Chuck...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:34 - 00:25:01]** can't see a darn thing so he's gonna take total defense okay that's it that's his turn that he has no idea what's going on you're up thaddeus is gonna shoot him so um he's gonna take a shot which is his final round in his venom caster and that is a 13 to hit does that hit it does not does not hit so then he's gonna take the rest of his round he's gonna like


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:23]** throw open like his gun and then like all the shells come out and he's gonna reload okay one two three four five six pushes them in termay you're up oh i forgot to mention because it was the the purple's turn the purples the purples the purples the perps it's hitting the are you hitting the perps

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:23]** Right.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:40]** So the purple witch word crumbles into a ball and then expands into a cloud that starts to coalesce into what looks like a model of an atom with a nucleus and thin lines circling it.

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:46]** It settles into a tiny mass surrounded by purple vines with pink and blue leaves.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:51]** The core of this beast is now a wild orchid with a monkey-like face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:53]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:54]** Okay.

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:55]** Chuck would love this if he could see it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:59]** I have to believe he could see it because it's, like, glowing.

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:00]** But, all right.

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:02]** I feel like he would.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:06]** I mean, I would love to be able to see it because then he could hit it.

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:10]** But if we're going to say he's blinded and can't hit it, then he definitely can't see it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:11]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:37]** so i don't know kev is this is this character giving off light uh no not according to the book cool okay cool wouldn't it say that on the character sheet somewhere if it was i mean perhaps if it says it's made of fire and lightning it's probably giving off light but that's just my opinion well you're you're trying to think through this rationally and we're not playing a


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:39]** We're not playing your rational.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:41]** I'm just a guy with a glass of bourbon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:41]** There it is.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:42]** So what's it going to be?

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:43]** I think it's Treme's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:44]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:47]** Okay.

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:54]** Treme is... Can I do like a life science check to see what's going on here?

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:56]** Or mysticism?

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:58]** What would...

**[00:26:58 - 00:27:05]** I guess I would probably go to Mysticism, in which case my Charisma is going to be impaired.

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:10]** So I'd have to take a minus to any Mysticism check, right?

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:13]** Because it's my key score.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:14]** Is it not adjusted on your Hero Lab?

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:16]** It doesn't seem to be.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:41]** and i haven't i mean i haven't used anything but i did click on like charisma poison plus two i guess it's whatever my key ability is right that's what informs my wisdom mysticism yeah okay is mysticism a charisma based check or is it wisdom that's what i'm trying to find out it it should just say on the rule book i think it would be based on whatever the type of caster wisdom right oh it's wisdom no it's wisdom oh then i'm fine


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:45]** What were you asking?

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:46]** What are you trying to find out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:47]** What is going on?

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:53]** What is the meaning behind these shapeshifts into our character forms?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:57]** Okay, I'll give that to you if you roll high enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:57 - 00:27:57]** 16.

**[00:27:58 - 00:27:58]** Do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:58 - 00:27:59]** I think so.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:00]** I'll let you know.

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:03]** A drift phantom has no fixed shape.

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:10]** It appears as a cloud of pink and purple energy lit by occasional flashes of electricity and like a bolt of lightning.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:22]** However, when other sentient creatures enter the vicinity, a drift phantom often takes a vague form of those creatures, shifting between shapes if there are more than one species present.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:29]** Some researchers believe this might be the Drew Phantom's attempt to communicate, but so far no one is sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:35]** It may be trying to communicate, but it's doing so in a very harmful way.

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:37]** So I'm going to full round tack if I can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:41]** Love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:43]** Okay.

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:46]** That was with a minus four.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:49]** Does a 14 hit EAC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:54]** 14 EAC does not hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:56]** Okay.

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:57]** Here we go.

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:57]** That misses too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:58 - 00:29:00]** All right.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:02]** We're back at the top of the next round.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:03]** Let me roll.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:05]** Full rounds, useless.

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:05]** We're at two.

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:06]** It's dim.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:11]** Let me knock down that windstorm to a nine.

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:12]** Nine more rounds of the windstorm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:16]** Rolu, it's your turn.

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:18]** Only 30 rounds of my no charisma.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:20]** So many rounds of no charisma.

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:26]** As the light goes up, you can see that Rolu is unconscious on the ground.

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:29]** His robes scattered about him.

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:31]** They're still on, just saying they're all over the place.

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:40]** And with that, Brillo is going to spend a resolve point to stabilize.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:41]** That's all he can do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:42]** Okay.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:46]** It is now the phantom's turn again.

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:48]** I might need some help with this.

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:51]** It wants that puck.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:51]** Okay.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:52]** So would I do a sleight of hand?

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:57]** Or is that... And you're also on the ground, unmoving.


## Speaker_0

**[00:29:58 - 00:29:58]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:58 - 00:29:59]** My take is that you can just try and grab it.

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:03]** I don't think you need to do a sleight of hand because you're not trying to go for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:05]** So what would I roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:07]** I kind of think you wouldn't need to roll.

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:09]** I mean, it is in my concealed compartment, so it's hidden.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:15]** So if you wanted to roll a sleight of hand to be able to successfully get into that, it's ultimately your call.

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:20]** Otherwise, I think it's the same as interacting with an item and you just reach down and pick something up personally.

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:21]** What does everyone else think?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:26]** I think it depends on whether or not Broly's trying to prevent him from...

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:27]** Oh, you're unconscious.

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:28]** So, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:28]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:29]** I'm unconscious.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:30]** I can't do anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:35]** I think since it's a secret compartment, there might be a chance that he doesn't find it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:36]** I will roll.

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:37]** Let me roll a perception check.

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:38]** Sure.

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:40]** And you decide the DC.

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:42]** What?

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:43]** I think they should decide the DC.

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:43]** 37.

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:44]** I don't know your value.

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:48]** So, like, maybe you use your sleight of hand plus 10 or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:49]** I don't know.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:52]** I'm not going to make this based on a skill that I have.

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:57]** It's just, honestly, like I'm just going to pick a DC based on what I know hardness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:59]** It doesn't see anything.

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:00]** It's a cool one.

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:01]** Okay.

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:04]** Even with my plus, yeah.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:05]** You're plus 50?

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:07]** 11 does not see anything, right?

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:08]** Okay.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:15]** And with that, it's going to just get kind of angry and make a rumble, lightning crackle noises.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:16]** Okay.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:26]** And a part of the cloud kind of swarms together and is going to shoot off towards Treme.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:29]** Oh, why would you do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:34]** Hey, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:36]** Hey, this is really awkward.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:38]** Why would you do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:38]** Excuse me.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:39]** What?

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:43]** Is this thing firing a ranged attack within my threatened squares?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:44]** Yes.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:51]** All right.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:53]** Well, I'm still doing my ranged attack.

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:55]** So does a 20, what did I say?

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:55]** 28 hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:57]** No, it doesn't hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:57 - 00:31:57]** That's too bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:58 - 00:32:00]** Yeah, of course it hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:03]** You take six points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:03]** Yikes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:06]** That's not nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:08]** Okay, Chuck, get your attack of opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:10]** I didn't crit, so it doesn't matter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:11]** What do you mean you didn't crit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:17]** I mean, my normal attack only does 1d3 plus 1, so it only matters if I crit.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:24]** I rolled a 22 to hit, but damage reduction means it's effectively zero unless I crit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:26]** I thought your Thath's fault.

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:26]** Oh, your Thath's fault.

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:28]** Thath, whatever.

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:29]** I can't say that word.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:32]** It was just strong against the ghost thingies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:37]** I mean, it's a 1d8 plus one, but there's no such thing as a ranged attack of opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:39]** Oh, I get it.

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:39]** I get it.

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:40]** I get it.

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:40]** I get it.

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:40]** I get it.

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:41]** I get it.

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:41]** Okay.

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:44]** So that is the end of the Drift Phantom's turn.

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:46]** Chuck, what are you doing now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:46 - 00:33:01]** I am going to try to assess where in, say, 0% to 100% of health this phantom is.

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:06]** Greater than or less than 50% is what I'm trying to deduce.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:09]** You're on mysticism?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:11]** Or perception?

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:13]** I can roll perception.

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:14]** I don't have mysticism.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:14]** Okay.

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:17]** 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:28]** You look at it and you're like, I don't know what dead would look like for this thing, but it looks pretty solid for being a cloud.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:30]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:31]** Well, that's no bueno.

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:32]** Oh, my God.

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:33]** Cool.

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:44]** Jack's going to take a guarded step away from this cloud to give it some separation and fire his light asphalt blaster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:45]** Okay.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:47]** Come on.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:48]** We got to hit.

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:49]** This is going to take forever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:51]** That's a 10 to EAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:53]** That does not hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:54]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:54]** Cool.

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:56]** Love that, Fermi.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:58]** Love that.

**[00:33:58 - 00:33:59]** Love, love, love that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:59 - 00:33:59]** Thaddeus, you're up.

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:00]** What are you doing?

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:05]** So Rolu is stable, which means he's not ticking down anymore, right?

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:07]** Which means if nothing else happens, he's going to live, right?

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:09]** If nothing else happens.

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:10]** Is that how that works?

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:40]** no technically if you're stable for a while I think every 24 hours you have to make a check so if you were to leave me here there's a chance I could die well that would be fun but don't want to really necessarily do that don't you hide your excitement so well but like but if the thing is like he's like a traitor and yeah might be a casualty could this thing like attack Rolu if he's down would it be inclined to do that

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:42]** I mean, I guess that's impossible to find out.

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:47]** But, like, can, like, it can attack something that's unconscious, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:49]** You can do, like, I don't know, a sense motive?

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:53]** Actually, there's a coup de grace.

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:54]** We talked about this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:56]** I think you have to be, like, standing over it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:56 - 00:35:00]** You have to be adjacent to it, and you get an automatic crit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:04]** Kev has definitely looked up this rule in the last 30 seconds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:07]** It's a 12 sense motive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:14]** Do you see a cloud that looks kind of like Jack hovering over?

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:15]** Yeah, I thought he said no idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:17]** All right.

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:18]** All right.

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:19]** Sorry.

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:22]** I need to figure out how far I can throw things again.

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:23]** Throw a Starfinder.

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:25]** Anyone know off the top of their head?

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:27]** Wait, throw a Starfinder?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:28]** Depends on what you're trying to throw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:29]** I want to throw something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:30]** Are you throwing a grenade or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:31]** Throw a serum.

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:34]** Oh, serum to roll it?


## Speaker_0

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:35]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:38]** Well, Rolu can't do shit, but, like, I was thinking, like, Shaq or, like, Termay.

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:39]** You know what I mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:42]** I was going to say, you could throw one to Shaq and he could administer it.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:44]** Rolu has one on his person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:44]** Oh!

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:46]** Didn't know that.

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:48]** That would have been great to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:50]** But is Shaq going to be able to successfully find it quickly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:54]** Uh, I would be able to... It's in one of his secret pockets.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:55]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:58]** I would have to... Yeah, I think I can... I'll work that out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:58 - 00:35:58]** All right.

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:00]** Shaq... Didn't know that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:01]** Sorry, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:02]** Well, I don't know that either.

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:04]** So, like, Thaddeus can't, like...

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:08]** Just as Kelly, I'm just going to, like, take back what I'm saying then in that case.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:10]** And I'm going to, like, do a full, like, attack.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:13]** With my tactical form invented.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:14]** All right.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:16]** So then, like, ranged attack.

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:16]** Here we go.

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:20]** Roll one is nine, which is not going to...

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:43]** hit and then they're like roll two is uh 22 and gonna roll damage right now right yeah wait sorry what were your two hits you you're doing just a single hit or nine and twenty but that's like a penalty right for a full round i did i took the penalty yes okay so the one hits and the other doesn't seven points of damage cut in half being three or four why is it cut in half

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:47]** Because this thing takes... Just tell me the full damage.

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:49]** Seven.

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:52]** It's five points total, right?

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:52]** It's not half.

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:55]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:57]** So it's only two damage.

**[00:36:58 - 00:36:58]** Yes.

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:00]** Effectively.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:02]** Oh, right.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:03]** That's your whole turn?

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:05]** Because you took a full round of attack?

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:09]** Somewhere to help the cop.

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:11]** Torme, it's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:13]** Oh, fine.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:17]** Torme is going to walk over and behind.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:28]** I mean, you know, like she's going to walk over the Grey's lifeless corpse to the square north side.

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:44]** East of Rolu, across from the cloud monster, in the most awkward fashion, pat Rolu down with one of his arms, like his lower arms, and find the...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:52]** Like this monster's at Rolly's feet and then Tremaine kind of waddles over to his head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:54]** Really awkwardly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:57]** Reaching as far as he can to pat down.

**[00:37:57 - 00:37:58]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:05]** Finds the healing serum that's sort of just like poking out of his satchel or something or, you know, pocket.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:05]** Yeah.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:11]** With like a life alert bracelet on his arm or around his neck, you know?

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:14]** In case of emergency, please administer this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:15]** Yes, yes.

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:20]** On his Apple Watch, you see that it says fall alert.

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:21]** Yeah, fall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:27]** And yes, I guess that's all I can do, right?

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:28]** That's your whole turn.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:28]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:31]** It's the next round.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:33]** Moving through these rounds really fast.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:36]** We might get to the end of this windstorm in the end.

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:38]** Rolo, you're up.

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:39]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:46]** I mean, I'm going to use stay in the fight to spend another resolve point to get back to one HP.

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:49]** Don't I roll for the serum or what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:50]** How does that work?

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:53]** No, you would be able to just take it off his body, I believe.

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:55]** But you don't, what do you mean roll for the serum?

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:56]** You can't apply the serum.

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:57]** That takes a full round action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:59]** It's a full, it's a full action to apply the serum.

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:00]** Got it.

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:01]** Yep.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:08]** So, yeah, he's going to expend one resolve point to stay in the fight, come back to one hit point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:09]** And that's your whole turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:09]** I think so.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:10]** Oh, wait.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:13]** You can do that and then get back up, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:15]** I think you get your full turn.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:17]** So you don't necessarily need to stand up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:19]** And take the rest of your turn as normal.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:19]** Yep.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:22]** He looks up, sees Thaddeus standing over him.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:25]** Jermaine standing over him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:28]** Hey, this is super awkward.

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:30]** By the way, I'm Turbay.

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:31]** My God.

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:33]** I think.

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:36]** Oh, yes, I am Thaddeus.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:37]** Meow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:45]** Meow.

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:54]** I think this thing still has reactions, so I think Rulu is going to scoot five feet back, which, as we know, crawling five feet back is my move action.

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:55]** Is that right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:56 - 00:40:22]** hear that right is that like a guarded step that you can do yeah can i guard a crawl i don't think so man why you guys keep asking the most complicated questions i think we got a rose lawyer for that one but not yeah yeah we need a new rules player we get to ask the rules lawyers the yeah we will speak like can i crawl five feet as a guarded step i don't believe you can asking


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:29]** So it's a move action, but I think in order to take a guarded step... You have to be up and be able to guard.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:31]** You have to step, not crawl.

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:32]** That tracks.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:35]** Because crawling five feet is your entire move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:36]** But does crawling provoke?

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:38]** I guess it would, because you're leaving the square.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:39]** It would.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:41]** Rulu's going to sit up.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:43]** He dropped his weapon.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:49]** He's going to grab his weapon as a move action, sit up, and...

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:51]** Well, I want to stab.

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:56]** I think Rolo would probably have reached to feel if the healing serum is there.

**[00:40:57 - 00:41:00]** But then he'll see that that Terme slash Thaddeus has it.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:03]** And he's not going to try and administer it right now.

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:04]** So I think.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:05]** Why did I take it?

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:08]** Because you were still unconscious.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:10]** Give it to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:10]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:13]** See, the thing is that Rolu has a wisdom of nine.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:20]** So I don't think he's wise enough to realize that by attacking right next to him, but that he's going to incur an attack.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:25]** But I also don't think that there's any other way to get out of it without incurring an AOO and dying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:25]** Roll it up.

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:28]** Make the wisdom roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:30]** Yeah.

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:31]** Yeah, I think so.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:36]** My wisdom modifier is negative one for all you keeping track at home.

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:38]** I rolled a three.

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:45]** So, yeah, he's going to sit up, and he's going to take an attack with his tactical spear.

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:46]** Oh, my.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:47]** Okay.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:49]** It's an archaic weapon, right?

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:49]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:50]** It's an analog.

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:55]** That is only going to be a 12 against KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:56]** That is a miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:57]** Okay.

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:57]** Okay.

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:00]** That's it.

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:08]** He gets up and is still dazed from having come unconscious and being close to death and calling Torme Thaddeus.

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:09]** And he misses.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:11]** That's his turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:11]** Meow.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:13]** Meow.

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:17]** What Torme means to say is it's really dumb to be doing what you're doing.

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:20]** You just literally are on the verge of death.

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:21]** Get the f*** out of there.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:29]** Also, rules paralegals responded in their usual very fast fashion and everyone says no, basically.

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:31]** Not unless you have a feature that lets you.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:33]** J.M.

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:36]** Bostwick, I don't know what their name is actually.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:39]** That is like almost certainly no.

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:40]** Let me check something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:41]** I think we figured that one out.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:43]** You can't really guard while you're prone.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:44]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:47]** Also, that's the crappy part about being prone.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:50]** If you're going to be a soldier and shoot from range, prone.

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:53]** Even though it would... Anyways.

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:54]** Right, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:56]** Well, this is for future news.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:57]** Yeah, no, I concur.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:58 - 00:42:59]** Dang it, I wanted to hear your rant.

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:02]** In fact, crawling five feet is a move action all on its own.

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:06]** You can't move more than five feet in a single crawl by default, and you're prone the entire time, J.M.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:07]** Bostwick said.

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:09]** Page 47, CRB.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:12]** All right, it is now the Drift Phantom's turn.

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:17]** The tiny purple Raxalite figure starts to grow...

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:21]** The leaves and vines combining into four thin but muscular arms.

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:23]** The core of the creature lengthens.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:31]** The petals of the flowery head close together and twist into an elongated head on top, far beyond the neckline.

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:38]** And despite the nebular composition of this creature, it appears to be wearing a cloth across its face, much like Rolo.

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:43]** And the creature is going to just lean in real close to Rolo.

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:46]** And it's going to reach for...

**[00:43:46 - 00:44:07]** my soul well i'm gonna do a perception check first because i'm still looking it's still looking do you have a soul does a 15 pass do i know where where on your body this thing is uh to me 15 is like just starting to get into the difficult territory so i think so

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:09]** Oh, okay.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:13]** Then can I do... Man, I didn't look this up beforehand.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:18]** Is there a combat maneuver where I can grapple you to get this thing from you?

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:19]** Like, what do I do now that you're awake?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:21]** I think you have to beat his KSC plus eight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:22]** Yeah, I think so, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:24]** I could just knock you down, though.

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:25]** I don't think it would know to do that.

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:28]** I think it would only... It's just going to attack.

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:32]** So it's going to do a slam attack on you.

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:36]** It's right in front of me.

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:37]** 19 on the die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:39]** You know, surprisingly, that doesn't hit.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:39]** That's fine.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:40]** It's weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:41]** I'm pretty sure that does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:44]** And it's a D4 plus 7.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:45]** Cool.

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:46]** Well, I'm down again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:50]** So that's a max damage of 11 points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:51]** You don't even need to roll.

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:52]** I'm down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:52 - 00:45:18]** it's fine uh and that's the end of the drift phantom's turn chalk what are you doing is the drift phantom still like flat-footed or whatever nope cool cool cool cool then chalk is going to sort of like oh let's see oh i'm hiding this uh i want to show this path because i think it's enough

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:49]** kev is that is that yeah agreeable i'll allow that okay so chalk is gonna run down and do like a candy cane shape uh hook and i see exactly what you're doing you're setting up to flank this creature i am okay and now i'm going to use my other action to try to negotiate with no i'm not i'm gonna use not in the face you leave me and my friends alone

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:50]** make a DC 14.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:51]** We'll save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:54]** Oh, I rolled a 14.

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:57]** I rolled, I rolled the 14.

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:59]** There's still, I didn't even add my bonuses to that.

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:00]** So fine.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:02]** Um, yeah, sorry.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:04]** That was a nice, nice moves though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:05]** Anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:07]** Ooh, it's Thaddeus.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:07]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:10]** Get the fool out of there.

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:12]** He's embarrassing himself.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:14]** What?

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:15]** Get him out.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:16]** Get the cob out.

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:17]** Good lord.

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:19]** It obviously wants what's on the cob.

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:24]** At this point, we might as well take whatever Rolu has for us and not let this purple thing get it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:26]** Get him away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:29]** All right.

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:32]** I can't do a combat maneuver or anything.

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:33]** You can do whatever you want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:34]** It's just what Thad wants you to do.

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:38]** What do you want me to do, Thad is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:40]** You can't get the cob out.

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:42]** If you get me up, I can also move out.

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:42]** Okay.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:44]** How do I get you up?

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:45]** You can, but will he?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:46]** Can I pick you up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:48]** No, but healing serum.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:53]** If you give me healing serum, I can stand up and not provoke and take a guarded step and get out of there.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:53]** Yeah.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:55]** You're still down?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:56]** Yeah, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:57]** I'm unconscious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:58 - 00:46:59]** All right.

**[00:46:59 - 00:46:59]** Yeah.

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:00]** 17 to hit.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:05]** I've already subtracted to get the 17, so I'm taking a full action here.

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:07]** And then...

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:11]** The next one will not hit.

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:17]** So I'm just going to roll for damage on the first one, which is nine minus five.

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:19]** Don't just tell me the total.

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:20]** I know that's what I'm doing right now.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:20]** Nine.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:21]** Nine damage.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:22]** Nine damage.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:22]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:28]** Because then if you tell me the minus, I'm going to end up taking out more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:30]** If you talk about nuclear power.

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:32]** I was trying to help out, but I don't want to.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:34]** I know that that can not be helpful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:35]** Just make things worse.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:36]** Cool.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:36]** Okay.

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:39]** That is the end of your turn, Termay.

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:40]** It is now your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:41]** What are you doing?

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:42]** Full round.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:56]** I'm going to take my serum and I'm going to awkwardly just sort of jab Rolu and look around aimlessly and be like, yo, did I do that just now?

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:58]** I feel like you stabbed me.

**[00:47:58 - 00:47:59]** I made a mistake.

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:01]** Yeah, I stabbed you like in the top of the head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:04]** Oh, God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:06]** Why did I ask for me to do this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:09]** That was really dumb now that I think about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:10]** That's amazing.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:12]** All right, roll a D8 to mark one.

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:14]** Tell me how much I get.

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:16]** Six.

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:16]** Not bad.

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:17]** Not bad.

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:17]** That's solid.

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:21]** That's solid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:24]** Pain in my head.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:27]** You stabbed me in my long head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:29]** You can't even use a move action.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:31]** You'd have to take a full move action to pull the needle out.

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:34]** It's still just stuck there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:36]** It's just dangling.

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:39]** Like you got hit with a dart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:42]** Oh my god.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:43]** Roller, you're now up.

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:44]** What are you doing?

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:47]** Before you do, let me roll for darkness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:49]** Watch it be complete dark again, then I'm blind.

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:51]** It is completely dark.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:52]** I rolled a five on the die.

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:53]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:56]** And let me knock down the windstorm one more round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:57]** All right.

**[00:48:58 - 00:49:27]** roll is going to stand up which does not provoke an attack of opportunity and he is going to take a guarded step back away from the creature and I think that's all that I can do to stay out of the range of this creature for now so I don't are you going to pick up your weapons you already did last turn oh no you dropped him again though he did I did could I think as part of the guarded step I would argue that I could pick them up but maybe I can't

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:28]** Maybe I can't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:33]** I don't think you can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:35]** I want to stand up and I want to get out of there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:41]** I would say that you could use... How are you going to guard yourself without the weapons?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:42]** He's got four arms.

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:44]** No, you wouldn't be able to pick your weapons up.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:47]** You'd have to do that separately.

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:49]** But you can do it from within five feet.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:51]** So you did your guard step back.

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:54]** You could just grab it your next turn.

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:55]** Does that make sense?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:57]** Assuming that they're still there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:57 - 00:50:00]** I would think that, I guess draw and sheath is different than pickup.

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:01]** Okay, cool.

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:01]** Yep, sounds good.

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:02]** That's my turn.

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:03]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:05]** What is the difference between draw?

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:06]** What are you saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:10]** It's not sheathed on his person, so it's not like he can quick react.

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:14]** It's not like he's just explaining why he can't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:16]** Yep, that's it.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:17]** Oh, okay.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:20]** Thank you, Torme, although I still feel something in my head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:22]** I'm very confused.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:27]** I'm not technically confused, but man, this got really awkward really quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:30]** Yeah, that was awkward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:32]** No charisma whatsoever.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:33]** Yeah, this is unlike you.

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:36]** I have to say that I usually find you very charming.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:38]** I don't know about you.

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:40]** I feel like you lost your mojo, man.

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:43]** You're spunk.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:45]** I don't even know if I like spicy food anymore.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:46]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:49]** People that can't handle spicy food.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:51]** It's just COVID.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:52]** You have COVID.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:53]** What's that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:56]** You can't taste anything.

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:56]** All right.

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:57]** That's Rolu's turn.

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:58]** Do you know what I get?

**[00:50:58 - 00:51:00]** It's the Drift Phantom's turn.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:03]** The Drift Phantom watches Rolu get up.

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:04]** You can kind of see its eyes shift.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:05]** It's going to come after me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:07]** Sorry.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:10]** It was in the shape of Rolu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:10]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:15]** Its arms start to twist together and rejoin.

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:23]** Its body kind of shortens up and thickens out into a long but not slender torso.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:24]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:25]** You know what's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:33]** Purple fur, crackling blue sparks all over, sharp ears, and the familiar face of a Patra.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:34]** Say built.

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:35]** Built.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:35 - 00:52:04]** built like not too swole but very yeah and so this cat like face as it shifts into the cat like face as it watches rolu step back this is the ugliest form it's in yeah you can't see it though rolu i need you to give me a will save it's a good thing you wouldn't wait who who has to give a person who has that reform rolu needs to give me a will save how though you can't see this what is any dart is in the room dark


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:06]** Yeah, I can't see the creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:11]** Okay, you don't see the creature, so you don't have to do a will save against the creature's attack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:12]** Oh, it's the attack.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:14]** I'm just asking, is the attack sight-based?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:15]** No.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:16]** All right.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:18]** And even if it was, the creature has sight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:19]** I thought you were discreet.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:22]** Sorry, I didn't mean to put that in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:24]** I'm very confused on what score I got now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:26]** Super awkward.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:28]** Roll charisma check.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:30]** Roll who got an 11.

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:31]** Super strong.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:31]** Oh, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:33]** You're going down twice.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:33]** Yep.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:33]** All right.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:34]** Hold on one second.

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:35]** Oh, I lost it.

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:36]** I almost lose.

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:38]** I have like a million tabs open.

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:39]** Yes, indeed.

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:40]** That's how it works.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:42]** I keep losing all of them.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:43]** Yep.

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:44]** They're all.

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:45]** All right.

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:49]** So you are frozen in place and become paralyzed.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:50]** Oh, God.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:53]** You are aware, but you breathe normally.

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:57]** You can't take any physical actions, even speak.

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:59]** You are currently held in place.

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:00]** You're by hold person.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:08]** So each round on your turn, you can spend a full action to attempt a new saving throw against this effect.

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:11]** Okay.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:11]** All right.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:14]** And it's going to last for a few rounds.

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:16]** Okay.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:16]** Three days.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:17]** Three full days.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:22]** And with that, the Phantom is going to step forward.

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:26]** And you're just frozen in place.

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:31]** And the phantom steps forward and almost goes like forehead to forehead.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:33]** What's the lighting right now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:34]** Dark.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:35]** Dark, yeah.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:38]** So you're under the blinded effect and total concealment.


## Speaker_0

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:38]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:42]** So, yeah, you can't see this thing, huh, John?

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:43]** Just saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:45]** No, I can't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:45]** Chuck, you're up.

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:46]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:48]** Chuck can't see anything, so he's taking total defense.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:49]** He's blinded.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:49]** Okay.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:51]** All right.

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:52]** Thaddeus, your move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:55]** Thaddeus, like, cocks back his gun again.

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:56]** Two shells.

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:57]** Fly out.

**[00:53:58 - 00:54:00]** He aims and fires twice.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:04]** And he misses.

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:06]** That's six.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:09]** Telling you the full points, that way that you don't yell at me.

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:12]** And then it's going to be...

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:18]** 15 to hit for his second shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:18]** That's a miss.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:20]** So your first is a 6 and your second was a 15?

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:21]** Yeah.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:23]** Both rounds miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:24]** Good God.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:27]** He's going to like... My God.

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:31]** Take that blue thing and get it away.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:32]** Get it away from him.

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:35]** We need to do some monkey in the middle.

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:35]** Sorry, Shaq.

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:38]** I'm not trying to be... You know what I mean, right?

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:40]** Monkey in the middle.

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:43]** Yeah, just keep it away from that purple monstrosity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:44]** And Treme, it's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:52]** Did you guys know that nuclear waste disposal and storage remains a long-term problem?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:53]** Stop it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:55]** Stop it.

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:59]** This remains radioactive for thousands of years like this windstorm over here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:01]** We don't want that on our hands.

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:03]** Solid plan, Will.

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:04]** Let's distract him.

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:07]** Have you all seen the Chernobyl miniseries?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:10]** Yo, that miniseries slaps.

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:11]** It's really good, man.

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:12]** It's really good.

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:15]** It's really good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:18]** It's widespread and well-known.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:19]** I've stopped listening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:22]** It's like a dramatic version of The Office.

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:26]** So I've administered this thing.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:28]** And Rollo's up, right?

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:30]** Up and paralyzed.

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:31]** Fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:31]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:35]** I can't really do anything about that.

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:36]** Sorry, bud.

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:37]** Gotta go.

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:41]** And Tremaine's going to take a darted step.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:43]** See ya.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:46]** See ya.

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:48]** Your eyes move because nothing else can.

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:49]** You just see him.

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:53]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_0

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:53]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:56]** And I'm going to shoot him.

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:58]** Shoot once.

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:01]** Natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:03]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:03]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:04]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:06]** Finally.

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:08]** Get it, Tormadin.

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:16]** And the Frostbite Class 0 has a critical effect, I believe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:18]** Ooh.

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:20]** I think you trade your critical effect for the card, though, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:20]** Is that what it said?

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:21]** I mean, that's your choice.

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:24]** It's my choice, too, if I want.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:25]** Maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:26]** You don't want to do the cards?

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:27]** Is that what you're saying?

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:29]** But let's do the double damage first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:33]** Yeah, so let me... Okay.

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:34]** Six points.

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:35]** Six points.

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:39]** And... Six points total?

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:40]** No.

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:41]** That was in the first roll.

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:42]** Oh, good.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:43]** Okay.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:48]** And max damage, seven points on the... Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:49]** Get it, boy.

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:54]** So, because I'm going to add it all together and then do the DR, so that's 13 points of damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:54]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:57]** Okay, so eight points to get through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:57 - 00:56:57]** Nice.


## Speaker_0

**[00:56:58 - 00:56:58]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:58 - 00:57:23]** now card or crit effect what's the crit effect frostbite or something staggered and you get a fourth what is staggered oh you get a fourth save or else what you get a fourth save i'm gonna yeah he gets a fourth save for one round it's stupid staggered is you can only take a single move or standard action each round so do you want to do that or do you want to do the cards let's do a quick card let's do the quick card

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:26]** They've asked for the crit card.

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:28]** I feel like staggered isn't enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:31]** And the DC is 13.

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:34]** So it's just an easy one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:35]** Yeah.

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:35]** All right.

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:38]** This creature is too powerful.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:40]** Tell me when to stop.

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:40]** Ready?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:42]** Three, two, one.

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:44]** Go, go, go, go.

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:44]** Now.

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:45]** Okay.

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:47]** And let's hope it's a wonder grenade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:50]** Let's hope it's nothing crazy.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:50]** Windstorm.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:52]** It's EAC damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:53]** Energy?

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:54]** Yeah, it's an energy wave.

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:54]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:58 - 00:57:58]** Yeah, it's okay.

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:01]** Wearying waves.

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:03]** The target is fatigued.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:04]** Ooh.

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:05]** That could work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:06]** I like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:08]** You cannot run or charge.

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:20]** You take a minus one penalty to AC, attack rolls, melee damage rolls, reflex saves, initiative checks, and strength and dex-based skill and ability checks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:25]** I really wish I just did something to this freaking DR, but oops.


## Speaker_0

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:26]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:28]** It's a minus one to everything, essentially.

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:29]** Literally everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:31]** AC, attack rolls, and melee damage rolls, and reflexes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:33]** Also, I don't think you can move as much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:37]** Yeah, you reduce your encumbered limit by one bolt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:39]** Yeah, you can't run or charge, but you can still do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:40]** You can't run or charge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:43]** I thought you could move at only half speed, too, but maybe that's different.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:45]** No, you can't run or charge.

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:46]** Cool, cool.

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:47]** Cool, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:51]** I think that's better than him doing a fort save and rolling a 40.

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:51]** 100%.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:52]** Right.

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:53]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:55]** And how long does that last for long?

**[00:58:55 - 00:59:19]** doesn't say so indefinitely it just says you're fatigued until you sleep yeah after eight hours of complete rest a long rest yeah you're no longer fatigued all right uh next round take that number down one more time we only got six rounds left of that whirlwind um and let's roll for darkness

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:22]** That's a two this time.

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:23]** We're in dim light again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:24]** Dope.

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:25]** Okay, we're back in dim light.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:32]** Yo, Rolo, you do realize now that the lights are on that you're standing in front of this guy, right?

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:36]** Oh, can he not move?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:40]** Man, this is awkward.

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:41]** It's Rolo's turn, right?

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:48]** It is your turn, and I believe it's a full action to attempt a new saving throw each round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:51]** Okay, good thing I have a plus zero to my will save.

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:52]** So it's just flat.

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:53]** Will save!

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:55]** Will save plus zero.

**[00:59:57 - 00:59:57]** Rolled a seven.

**[00:59:58 - 00:59:59]** Don't think that helps.

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:01]** I'm still paralyzed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:02]** That is not enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:03]** Great.

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:06]** I love this type of combat.

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:07]** This is my favorite ever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:09]** Combat where you don't get to do anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:12]** I just roll a dice and don't add or subtract anything.

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:13]** Cool.

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:14]** That's my turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:16]** Super easy to just play, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:19]** Yeah, it's really easy to role play.

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:23]** I just don't move or say anything, and I roll a dice.

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:23]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:28]** So we're out trying to change the pace, to be honest, but it's not really good timing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:29]** So rude.

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:30]** All right, Kev.

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:39]** Kev is breathing out and looking at several screens at once, and I feel like he is deciding how ruthless he's going to be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:46]** If it's anything like the proliferation of nuclear weapons used to produce nuclear power.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:47]** Stop it.

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:48]** All right.

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:49]** What are you going to do, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:54]** And also the high cost of maintaining nuclear power plants.

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:54]** It's just...

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:59]** I imagine that's how Tremaden is taunting this cloud.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:02]** Yeah, I want you to read that all in Tremaden.

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:04]** Please don't.

**[01:01:04 - 01:01:05]** Don't continue on.

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:21]** Okay, so the Patra then transforms again into a stout body with the legs start to contort and bend backwards, forearms, you know, and it's got the long robes of Tremaden.

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:28]** And as it does that, it's going to glance at Treme, knowing that you're trying to help this paralyzed creature.

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:34]** And it's going to... I'm going to require a will save from you as well.

**[01:01:34 - 01:01:35]** Will save?

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:36]** From who?

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:37]** Will save, please pass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:37 - 01:01:38]** From Treme.

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:40]** Treme is... Does a 17 do it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:43]** Yeah, it does.

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:44]** And it just... Nice!

**[01:01:45 - 01:01:46]** Completely.

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:50]** And with that, it's going to move... Oh, my mouse.

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:55]** So it does that, and it's going to actually move over to here.

**[01:01:55 - 01:01:55]** Oh, God.

**[01:01:55 - 01:02:01]** It's going to cross up and kind of step in between Rolu and Torme.

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:01]** Whoa.

**[01:02:02 - 01:02:04]** But it's also up near the drift drive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:08]** Why you buy this stupid drive beast?

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:09]** Maybe it heals him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:09 - 01:02:10]** Don't let him in now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:10 - 01:02:12]** Dude, that would be the worst possible condition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:13]** That would suck very much.

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:20]** That would be the absolute worst thing in the world besides duplier power.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:20 - 01:02:22]** If I were GM, I would nix that ability.

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:23]** Anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:25]** Nix what ability?

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:26]** What are you talking about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:28]** To be healed by the drift engine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:29]** Oh.

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:30]** Uh-huh.

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:32]** Chuck, what's your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:49]** Uh, Chuck is going to level his light asphalt blaster, uh, after he takes a quick measurement to make sure he's in range and, uh, just fire once at this drift phantom.

**[01:02:49 - 01:03:18]** that's a 7 to hit strong showing and then he's going to show his measuring tape to the rest of the world and show the GM how he wants to move sort of just outside of the reach of the drift phantom sort of a float like a butterfly sting like a beaver attempt


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:25]** The known wild stinging beavers of Canada.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:26]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:26]** And that's your turn?

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:27]** That's his turn.

**[01:03:27 - 01:03:27]** All right.

**[01:03:27 - 01:03:34]** So you guys are kind of moving up and around to kind of huddle around this creature, but you're also right next to that drift drive and the dead gray.

**[01:03:34 - 01:03:39]** Oh, and Rolu is paralyzed in place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:39 - 01:03:40]** Worst condition for Rolu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:41]** For another round.

**[01:03:42 - 01:03:43]** Thaddeus, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:44 - 01:03:47]** So he's not able to help Rolu become unparalyzed, right?

**[01:03:47 - 01:03:49]** There's nothing that he can really do for this.

**[01:03:49 - 01:03:51]** Is that like a medicine check or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:52]** I don't believe so, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:52 - 01:03:53]** Yeah, got you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:54]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:55 - 01:03:58]** He's going to... Alright, he's going to shoot the f***ing thing again.

**[01:03:59 - 01:04:02]** But he has to reload first, so all shells come out, reload.

**[01:04:03 - 01:04:05]** Going to do a regular ranged attack.

**[01:04:06 - 01:04:08]** And he aims and misses with an eight.

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:14]** And then he... I'm so angry right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:15]** You can just roll better.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:15 - 01:04:17]** Yeah, I can just roll better.

**[01:04:17 - 01:04:18]** That's true.

**[01:04:18 - 01:04:19]** I forgot about that.

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:21]** I wish I had magic missile right now.

**[01:04:22 - 01:04:22]** But go on.

**[01:04:23 - 01:04:24]** Oh, that was your whole turn?

**[01:04:24 - 01:04:25]** I thought there was more.

**[01:04:26 - 01:04:27]** I reloaded and then I shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:27 - 01:04:29]** Okay, yeah, yeah.

**[01:04:29 - 01:04:30]** Termite, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:30 - 01:04:30]** Ugh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:32 - 01:04:53]** tell you what i'm not doing and that's uh just jokes about nuclear power yeah dispose of nuclear waste properly anyways i'm gonna take i just don't have the bandwidth to argue with you right now so it's the perfect time to get it in right uh yeah that's exactly it um i can counter every i read them i can counter every one of those


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:53 - 01:05:21]** easily hey i didn't it's not my argument okay anyways to basically i guess take a step back okay can i do like an engineering check on this drift drive being under it is there a way like i can just disable it or is it like enabled in any sort of way like mechanically can i blow up like some conduit on it and do some sort of engineering check to see sure yeah okay so just roll that's

**[01:05:22 - 01:05:23]** Whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:23 - 01:05:24]** Engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:25]** Yeah.

**[01:05:25 - 01:05:25]** 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:25 - 01:05:26]** Ooh, that met.

**[01:05:27 - 01:05:28]** Yeah.

**[01:05:28 - 01:05:35]** So you recognize the drift power core was a prototype, but it's definitely been re-engineered.

**[01:05:36 - 01:05:38]** It's also currently broken.

**[01:05:38 - 01:06:03]** and you recognize that all the equipment kind of around it even the broken stuff um it's all related to electrical engineering and power dynamics and it was probably nuclear power you know because that's the best uh but it's all very apparently done by the gray at this point it's and it's not working it's not functional there's nothing coming from it so no there's no way to rig it to blow

**[01:06:03 - 01:06:27]** uh or like there's nothing to blow so there's probably no reason other than to maybe get close to the gray right that he's over here i guess i wouldn't know that or there's no way yeah you you know enough that there's nothing like the the drive is no longer functional there's nothing on it yeah all right uh i'm gonna take a garden step back


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:27 - 01:06:28]** And take a shot.

**[01:06:28 - 01:06:31]** That is a dirty 22.

**[01:06:32 - 01:06:33]** Nice.

**[01:06:35 - 01:06:36]** Nice.

**[01:06:36 - 01:06:37]** Come on.

**[01:06:38 - 01:06:39]** Killing blow.

**[01:06:40 - 01:06:42]** Max freaking damage.

**[01:06:42 - 01:06:43]** Let's get it.

**[01:06:43 - 01:06:45]** Which is seven points, so two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:47 - 01:06:48]** All right.

**[01:06:48 - 01:06:49]** Yes, two.

**[01:06:49 - 01:06:51]** Two points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:51 - 01:06:55]** I literally just gave it everything I could, and there's nothing.

**[01:06:55 - 01:06:56]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:56 - 01:06:57]** You're chipping away at it?

**[01:06:57 - 01:06:58]** Chipping away.

**[01:06:58 - 01:06:58]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:58 - 01:07:00]** I got a chip and a chair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:00 - 01:07:02]** Back to the top of the round.

**[01:07:02 - 01:07:05]** That's one less round for the windstorm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:05 - 01:07:08]** I'm not even really counting the charisma.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:08 - 01:07:09]** Dim light still in the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:10 - 01:07:10]** Okay.

**[01:07:10 - 01:07:11]** What round is this?

**[01:07:11 - 01:07:12]** This is crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:12 - 01:07:13]** I have not been keeping track.

**[01:07:13 - 01:07:14]** We're on like round 14.

**[01:07:14 - 01:07:14]** All right.

**[01:07:15 - 01:07:16]** Rolo, you're up.

**[01:07:16 - 01:07:16]** All right.

**[01:07:16 - 01:07:17]** 12.

**[01:07:17 - 01:07:18]** 12 what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:18 - 01:07:19]** First paralysis.

**[01:07:19 - 01:07:19]** That's why we'll save.

**[01:07:20 - 01:07:22]** Oh, we'll save, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:22 - 01:07:23]** Oh, no, that doesn't pass, no.

**[01:07:23 - 01:07:25]** Okay.

**[01:07:25 - 01:07:25]** Okay.

**[01:07:25 - 01:07:27]** So you've been, that's three rounds now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:28 - 01:07:29]** Yeah, that's three rounds now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:29 - 01:07:30]** All right.

**[01:07:31 - 01:07:31]** That's your whole turn.

**[01:07:31 - 01:07:33]** The phantom's turn now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:33 - 01:07:39]** John is all the way laid back in his seat, staring at the ceiling, like contemplating his life choices.

**[01:07:39 - 01:07:40]** What else can one do, man?

**[01:07:40 - 01:07:41]** It's so bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:41 - 01:07:43]** I'm just doing my best Rolo impersonation.


## Speaker_0

**[01:07:43 - 01:07:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:44 - 01:07:50]** I think since you're paralyzed, the creature is going to... Can I hit Chalk from here?

**[01:07:50 - 01:07:52]** You're in a five-foot square.

**[01:07:52 - 01:07:53]** I can hit you, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:53 - 01:07:54]** Yes.

**[01:07:54 - 01:07:55]** Yes, you could.

**[01:07:55 - 01:07:55]** All right.

**[01:07:56 - 01:07:57]** That's a thing that you could do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:57 - 01:07:59]** It's going to attack Chalk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:59 - 01:08:02]** You do have a minus one on this attack.

**[01:08:02 - 01:08:03]** You do have a minus one.

**[01:08:04 - 01:08:04]** I do.

**[01:08:04 - 01:08:04]** I got that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:04 - 01:08:06]** You got all that stuff.


## Speaker_0

**[01:08:06 - 01:08:06]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:06 - 01:08:08]** Yeah, I wrote it all down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:08 - 01:08:11]** So you're only adding 20 to your attack roll instead of 21.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:11 - 01:08:21]** So Rolo is paralyzed, and the drift phantom is to the right, and Chalk is in a square just north, straight above.

**[01:08:21 - 01:08:23]** And so they are diagonal from each other.

**[01:08:24 - 01:08:25]** And so I can roll to attack.

**[01:08:25 - 01:08:30]** That is 23 to hit.

**[01:08:31 - 01:08:32]** Does that hit?

**[01:08:34 - 01:08:34]** I hear silence.

**[01:08:34 - 01:08:35]** I'm not looking at the screen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:36 - 01:08:37]** Level three plant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:38 - 01:08:39]** Can I guess what you're going to say?

**[01:08:40 - 01:08:41]** That's eight points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:46 - 01:08:47]** You what?

**[01:08:47 - 01:08:48]** No, no, no.

**[01:08:48 - 01:08:48]** It's fine.

**[01:08:49 - 01:08:51]** I was just sort of going to...

**[01:08:53 - 01:08:55]** I was just going to, I don't know.

**[01:08:55 - 01:09:01]** I was going to provide some, like, thoughts on, like, the futility of, you know, the human will or something.

**[01:09:01 - 01:09:03]** Let's kill this thing or be killed by it.

**[01:09:03 - 01:09:04]** Yeah, it's good.

**[01:09:05 - 01:09:05]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:05 - 01:09:09]** And I think it's going to take a guarded step during that slam.

**[01:09:09 - 01:09:13]** It's going to, boom, hit you and then step right over Chak.

**[01:09:14 - 01:09:16]** So now he's just above Rolu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:09:16 - 01:09:18]** That noise, I'm taking an attack of opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:18 - 01:09:18]** Over.

**[01:09:19 - 01:09:21]** I did a guarded step.

**[01:09:21 - 01:09:21]** Ah, s***.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:09:21 - 01:09:24]** Yeah, you're right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:24 - 01:09:25]** It's a bold move, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:09:26 - 01:09:27]** It's a bold move, Cotton.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:09:27 - 01:09:29]** It's a bold move, Cotton.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:29 - 01:09:31]** But it's your turn now, so let's see what happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:09:31 - 01:09:32]** Oh, it's Chalk's turn?

**[01:09:32 - 01:09:35]** Hmm...

**[01:09:35 - 01:09:38]** Time for one of those handy-dandy wisdom saves.

**[01:09:38 - 01:09:52]** So Chalk is fed up with this ghost, and I think what Chalk would want to do is take his light asphalt blaster and just tilt it straight up because he doesn't like being disrespected by being stepped over.

**[01:09:52 - 01:09:54]** He doesn't like the Allen Iverson treatment.

**[01:09:55 - 01:09:57]** So here we go.

**[01:09:57 - 01:09:58]** Is that a full attack?

**[01:09:58 - 01:10:00]** That is an eight on the will save, so yeah.

**[01:10:00 - 01:10:01]** F*** him.

**[01:10:01 - 01:10:02]** It's a full attack.

**[01:10:02 - 01:10:02]** Yes.

**[01:10:02 - 01:10:04]** Roll your attack of opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:04 - 01:10:05]** Because you're doing a ranged attack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:10:06 - 01:10:07]** Yeah, he's doing a ranged attack.

**[01:10:07 - 01:10:10]** He's taking two light asphalt blasters to the phantom testicles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:11 - 01:10:14]** Ooh, that is a 19 on the die.

**[01:10:17 - 01:10:18]** I don't get an attack of opportunity.

**[01:10:18 - 01:10:19]** No, because it's a reaction, so I only get one.

**[01:10:19 - 01:10:20]** You only get one.

**[01:10:20 - 01:10:21]** Not two.

**[01:10:22 - 01:10:27]** Okay, so that is going to be 11 points of damage from the slam.

**[01:10:31 - 01:10:33]** Lightning strikes out in all directions as he does it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:10:33 - 01:10:37]** That's an eight and a 17 to EAC.

**[01:10:37 - 01:10:37]** He's still up.

**[01:10:38 - 01:10:38]** He's still up.

**[01:10:38 - 01:10:39]** He's still up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:39 - 01:10:40]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:10:40 - 01:10:41]** The 17 hits.

**[01:10:44 - 01:10:45]** Come on, chat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:10:47 - 01:10:51]** Chuck, Chuck, Chuck, Chuck, Chuck, Chuck, Chuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:10:51 - 01:10:54]** That's a seven on the die for eight bludgeoning damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:10:56 - 01:10:57]** All right.

**[01:10:57 - 01:10:58]** That's pretty decent.

**[01:10:58 - 01:10:59]** Chuck with three points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:59 - 01:11:00]** Yeah, Chuck.

**[01:11:01 - 01:11:02]** Five points of DR is a lot, man.

**[01:11:03 - 01:11:06]** I almost was like, oh, I'm not going to do DR at all because that's silly.

**[01:11:06 - 01:11:08]** But no, fuck you guys.

**[01:11:08 - 01:11:11]** Especially Will with his nuclear power bullshit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:12 - 01:11:15]** This long episode brought to you by DR.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:15 - 01:11:16]** What are you doing?

**[01:11:16 - 01:11:17]** And nuclear power.

**[01:11:17 - 01:11:18]** And nuclear power.

**[01:11:18 - 01:11:20]** And nuclear power.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:20 - 01:11:25]** The gift that keeps on giving.

**[01:11:28 - 01:11:28]** I'm doing it.

**[01:11:28 - 01:11:29]** I'm doing it.

**[01:11:29 - 01:11:30]** 13 to hit.

**[01:11:30 - 01:11:30]** I'm sorry.

**[01:11:30 - 01:11:31]** I'm sorry.

**[01:11:31 - 01:11:31]** 18.

**[01:11:31 - 01:11:35]** Do your subtractions, sir.

**[01:11:35 - 01:11:39]** I'm doing a full attack, so Thaddeus is doing a full attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:39 - 01:11:41]** I don't know the math that goes into your attack roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:41 - 01:11:45]** In actual fact, I rolled a 14.

**[01:11:46 - 01:11:47]** Okay.

**[01:11:47 - 01:11:49]** Because it's a full action and it's my first roll.

**[01:11:49 - 01:11:50]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:51 - 01:11:55]** So you rolled an 18 on the die and a minus four from the... Minus four.

**[01:11:55 - 01:11:56]** Okay.

**[01:11:56 - 01:11:58]** And so it's a 14 to hit, you said?

**[01:11:58 - 01:11:58]** Yes, it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:59 - 01:12:01]** It should hit because you were 15 before.

**[01:12:02 - 01:12:04]** And you should have a minus one because you're fatigued.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:04 - 01:12:06]** I am keeping track of all that.

**[01:12:06 - 01:12:07]** Why do you guys keep questioning me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:07 - 01:12:10]** I thought a 15 hit before.

**[01:12:10 - 01:12:11]** 15 hits EAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:12:11 - 01:12:12]** I don't think a 15 hit before.

**[01:12:12 - 01:12:13]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:14 - 01:12:14]** Oh.

**[01:12:14 - 01:12:15]** Wait.

**[01:12:15 - 01:12:15]** Is this K's?

**[01:12:16 - 01:12:16]** Okay.

**[01:12:17 - 01:12:17]** This is K's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:12:18 - 01:12:19]** It's fine.

**[01:12:19 - 01:12:19]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:19 - 01:12:20]** So what's your second hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:21 - 01:12:24]** That was my first roll, so now I'm going to re-roll.

**[01:12:24 - 01:12:27]** It's a 12.

**[01:12:27 - 01:12:29]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:30 - 01:12:31]** So you miss.

**[01:12:31 - 01:12:32]** All right.

**[01:12:32 - 01:12:33]** Treme, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:34 - 01:12:45]** Well, I'm going to get a full round attack, much like the risk of cancer associated with nuclear power.

**[01:12:45 - 01:12:51]** The 14,500 nuclear power plants it would take to...

**[01:12:51 - 01:12:52]** meet the world's energy needs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:53 - 01:12:54]** Oh, f*** me.

**[01:12:54 - 01:12:54]** Am I f***ing up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:55 - 01:12:55]** Uh-oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:55 - 01:13:12]** All right, so I'm an idiot, and DR actually does... EAC attacks do hit on DR. It only stops bludgeon damage, but that confuses me because your Thastron stuff, that doesn't... Anyways, so I adjusted.

**[01:13:12 - 01:13:13]** I adjusted for the fight.

**[01:13:15 - 01:13:17]** I know how much HP is left on this thing,

**[01:13:17 - 01:13:18]** What just happened, Will?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:13:19 - 01:13:21]** I just rolled a natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:22 - 01:13:22]** Nice.

**[01:13:23 - 01:13:24]** Let's end this fight.

**[01:13:24 - 01:13:25]** Let's see what happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:13:26 - 01:13:31]** That was the first of a full round attack, so does that reduce it?

**[01:13:32 - 01:13:36]** That's probably a flavor question, but I would assume it would still hit.

**[01:13:36 - 01:13:37]** Yeah, it hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:38 - 01:13:39]** It's still a crit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:13:39 - 01:13:40]** Yeah, okay.

**[01:13:40 - 01:13:43]** Should I roll the other attack, or should I not bother yet?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:43 - 01:13:46]** I think we should worry about damage first from your crit...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:13:47 - 01:13:49]** First one is six points.

**[01:13:50 - 01:13:52]** Second one is four points.

**[01:13:53 - 01:13:54]** So 10 points of damage.

**[01:13:54 - 01:13:57]** And this is energy, so it goes through, right?

**[01:13:57 - 01:13:57]** Yep.

**[01:13:57 - 01:13:57]** Okay.

**[01:13:57 - 01:13:58]** It goes all the way through.

**[01:13:58 - 01:13:58]** Just clarifying that.

**[01:13:59 - 01:14:04]** And rather than do the staggered, let's do the crit deck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:14:04 - 01:14:04]** Ooh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:14:04 - 01:14:06]** Let's do the crit deck.


## Speaker_0

**[01:14:06 - 01:14:06]** Ooh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:14:06 - 01:14:08]** He's requested the crit tech, everybody.

**[01:14:08 - 01:14:10]** He's requested the crit tech.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:14:10 - 01:14:10]** Bold move.

**[01:14:10 - 01:14:12]** We'll see if it works out for him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:14:12 - 01:14:12]** Bold move, Cotton.

**[01:14:13 - 01:14:13]** Let's find out.

**[01:14:13 - 01:14:13]** Ready?

**[01:14:14 - 01:14:15]** Going to do a quick shuffle.

**[01:14:16 - 01:14:18]** And three, two, one.

**[01:14:18 - 01:14:19]** Stop.

**[01:14:19 - 01:14:19]** Stop.

**[01:14:20 - 01:14:20]** Stop.

**[01:14:21 - 01:14:22]** Take the top.

**[01:14:22 - 01:14:24]** It is EAC, right?

**[01:14:24 - 01:14:25]** Correct.

**[01:14:26 - 01:14:26]** Energy.

**[01:14:27 - 01:14:28]** All to one arm.

**[01:14:28 - 01:14:37]** The crit effect is the target cannot use one randomly determined arm for 1d3 rounds.

**[01:14:38 - 01:14:39]** That's random.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:14:39 - 01:14:40]** That is random.

**[01:14:40 - 01:14:41]** Super random.

**[01:14:41 - 01:14:45]** So I rolled a 1d6 and have it?

**[01:14:45 - 01:14:50]** You can't use your arm for one round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:14:50 - 01:14:52]** He's the cat shape right now, right?

**[01:14:52 - 01:14:53]** So it's only one arm.

**[01:14:54 - 01:14:57]** It would have been worse if it was one of the forearm creatures.

**[01:14:57 - 01:14:59]** Okay, so how many rounds?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:14:59 - 01:15:00]** One round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:15:01 - 01:15:02]** One more round.

**[01:15:02 - 01:15:03]** All right, and go ahead.

**[01:15:03 - 01:15:05]** Give me your second hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:15:06 - 01:15:08]** That is a 14 to hit.

**[01:15:09 - 01:15:10]** EAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:15:10 - 01:15:11]** That one misses.

**[01:15:12 - 01:15:13]** Okay, that one misses.

**[01:15:13 - 01:15:21]** But that first shot hits, and you see it kind of absorb into the cloud.

**[01:15:23 - 01:15:29]** And the creature's form starts to continuously shift from Patra, Kasathan, Raxalite, to which word?

**[01:15:30 - 01:15:31]** Back to Patra.

**[01:15:33 - 01:15:35]** all while letting out these violent shrieks.

**[01:15:36 - 01:15:40]** And then it dissolves into sparks of purple and pink energy.

**[01:15:40 - 01:15:45]** These particles blast outward, past through each of you before piercing the walls.

**[01:15:47 - 01:15:49]** You each feel a tingling sensation in your extremities.

**[01:15:51 - 01:15:58]** That feeling moves up your limbs and into your core as each of you level up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:15:58 - 01:15:59]** There it is.


## Speaker_0

**[01:16:00 - 01:16:00]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:16:01 - 01:16:14]** As this is happening, Thaddeus walks up to Rolu, sees he's still paralyzed, holds the gun to his head, and says, freeze.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:16:14 - 01:16:18]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:16:20 - 01:16:21]** There it is.

**[01:16:21 - 01:16:25]** No, but seriously, you and I are going to have a long chat, Cobb.

**[01:16:30 - 01:16:33]** Thanks for listening, you scallywags.

**[01:16:33 - 01:16:39]** Until next week, drift begones on Distant Stars.
