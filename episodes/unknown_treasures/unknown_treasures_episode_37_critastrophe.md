## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:00:01 - 00:00:12]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:13]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:15]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:16]** Get out.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:20]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:22]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:22 - 00:00:30]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales of the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:33]** Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:00:56 - 00:01:00]** Welcome back to We'll Save in the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:01:01 - 00:01:03]** I'm Kevin, the GM of Unknown Treasures.

**[00:01:03 - 00:01:08]** Just a reminder, if you've been listening this far along, we are running Junker's Delight.

**[00:01:08 - 00:01:12]** This is the AP, or the standalone adventure is Junker's Delight.

**[00:01:13 - 00:01:14]** Just a reminder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:14 - 00:01:16]** Junk to delight in.

**[00:01:16 - 00:01:18]** Just wanted to remind people of episode 37.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:18 - 00:01:20]** Yeah, much like this podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:20 - 00:01:22]** Yeah, in case you don't know right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:25]** If you're curious and you want to go read the book and see what's going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:25 - 00:01:26]** I think it's good.

**[00:01:26 - 00:01:49]** because sometimes you just get lost in the sauce of the story you're just going you're playing especially if you're listening to this not on live on we'll save wednesday which if you're not what are you doing but if you're not you know years down the road probably and you're like you know going through just enjoying and then you're like oh that's right this is junkers delight this is a cool adventure yeah yeah it's good support i think i'm not sure you guys know that surprise


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:49 - 00:02:15]** i didn't honestly i didn't know that we were doing you know i honestly don't even think about it as joker's delight i think about it as we'll save i think about it as the wills yeah exactly it's our side story because desert files for those who files because like you probably yeah the desert files that's actually a pretty good way of putting it you can tell like we've we have our universe kind of woven into it so i don't know that's how i think about it anyway yeah i agree

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:17]** But I still like your story, Jason Keeley.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:22]** I'm sure 90% of it is from you and the 10% that's annoying is from Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:23]** Yeah, absolutely.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:26]** The annoying 10% is all Kevin.

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:27]** It's probably accurate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:29]** The 20 extra enemies, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:36]** But before we get to the game itself, because, you know, that's fun and all, but I was going to talk about other games, because last week we brought them up.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:39]** And, like, what's going on right now is you're in the Stellar Flare.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:40]** It's a little creepy.

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:41]** There's stuff going on you guys can't explain.

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:44]** And I think it was Vinny that brought up Fear.

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:45]** Classic.

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:47]** Which is one of my favorite video games.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:49]** Like, it was just...

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:50]** Platform breaking.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:54]** It was like, whoa, you could do this kind of thing in video games and get away with it.

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:55]** I actually had to look it up.

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:58]** It's a backronym for First Encounter Assault Recon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:58 - 00:02:58]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:03]** But the whole thing was like you were basically a recon team going in to fight ghosts.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:10]** And the way they did it was so... You would turn a corner and walk down a hallway, and the next thing you know, you're drowning in blood.

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:11]** And you're just like, what the heck?

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:12]** Yeah, it was so good.

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:13]** So well done.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:16]** There has been like five of them since...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:17]** Yeah, I haven't played those.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:25]** The first one highlighted for me that I have a fear of moving vehicles coming towards me in enclosed spaces and I can't get out of the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:26]** The bus?

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:27]** Is it a bus or a train or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:29]** There's like a van that comes down an alley.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:30]** I remember that.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:31]** And you have to run.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:33]** And there's no door behind you?

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:35]** You just have to run and turn the corner.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:36]** That was scary.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:37]** Oh, it's so good.

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:39]** But the weapons were also great.

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:44]** There was a good futuristic technology aspect, so you didn't feel like you were totally powerless.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:45]** Yeah, it was classic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:48]** Oh, yeah, you were going in prepared to fight ghosts.

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:49]** That's the point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:50]** I guess.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:52]** No one told me what I played in.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:55]** That's probably me.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:56]** This was 1.30.

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:59]** This is like a core memory for me.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:01]** John spins it up at like 1.30.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:03]** Hey, dude, I just got this really cool game.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:04]** You should play it.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:05]** Closes the door behind him.


## Speaker_0

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:06]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:08]** I'm just like, okay, cool.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:10]** We're walking down a hallway.

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:14]** And he also had the 7.1 surround sound headphones.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:20]** So from the back right, I hear a little girl whisper, over here.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:23]** I'm like, what?

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:24]** What is happening?

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:26]** I turn around.

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:27]** My character turns around.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:28]** There's nobody there.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:29]** I walk a little farther.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:31]** I hear it again and turn around.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:34]** And then she just launches at my face.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:35]** Alt F4.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:37]** Shut it down.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:38]** That's it.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:39]** I'm done.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:40]** Check, please.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:42]** It's very reasonable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:46]** You guys remember the video game arcades that don't exist anymore?

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:48]** I think we talked about this a few times.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:52]** Everybody just gathers in a computer room and yells at each other.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:53]** Land parties.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:55]** I was just talking about this yesterday.

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:58]** There's back rooms that exist some places.

**[00:04:58 - 00:04:59]** I'm sure.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:02]** Over here, there's a shit ton of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:05]** I knew a friend that operated one of those.

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:09]** It was actually really cool because it was like a...

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:10]** hot rod body shop.

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:28]** Um, and then in like the spare room, they were, they were converted over to a land party area and it was awesome, but they had two, they had one closet essentially that they, they decorated that it was like corrugated steel, but they tore the steel and put neon blood all over it and had black lights and stuff.

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:33]** And they had two computers in there that were powerful enough to run doom for when it first came out.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:37]** And so like, you'd go in and shut the door behind you and play doom for, um,

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:40]** And yeah, Doom 4 was the first game that you couldn't see the seams.

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:44]** Like, I remember walking up a set of stairs and the stairs exploded.

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:50]** And it was just so smooth that I didn't realize, like, where prior to that, like, you know, it's got a different texture to it.

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:51]** It's got a different color.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:55]** Just one other game that I just have to bring up is that I really liked.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:58]** It was kind of on the crappier side, an independent game.

**[00:05:58 - 00:05:59]** It's called Stalker.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:01]** And it was based in Chernobyl.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:03]** But it was about ghosts and stuff.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:06]** And, like, basically, like, the Chernobyl explosion was actually a cover-up.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:29]** for all these experiments that were happening it was it was like an rpg first person shooter it was great i really enjoyed it but all right that's not video game talk except for like kelly you said wait here here they have those still where is here oh yeah talking about i'm in japan at this moment what what what well we'll save far east we'll save in the rising sun


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:30]** Yeah.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:31]** Yeah.

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:32]** Rising will save.

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:34]** I'm like, I'm there.

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:36]** I'm an hour and 17 minutes ahead.

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:37]** And one day.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:38]** I don't know.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:40]** And one day or something like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:41]** Or an hour and half.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:42]** God, I can't even think.

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:45]** I'm so ahead that I can't even think properly.

**[00:06:45 - 00:07:06]** so his brain is still ahead you guys are so behind me they have like the pc cafes they still have them but then after this i'm going to be in korea for a couple weeks and in korea they definitely have them they definitely have yeah they're still everywhere everywhere over there um and hopefully the wi-fi will be a little better in korea than here so apologies about any lag


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:06]** No, you're fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:08]** I said that about Japan too earlier, but who knows?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:09]** I'm curious.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:13]** Are the LAN parties like up-to-date computers?

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:19]** Because they originally started as like just access for the internet and like whatever games were available at the time.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:21]** And then they started ramping up into like

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:24]** We have the best games available, blah, blah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:30]** The places that I've seen have rates for different PCs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:31]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:37]** So, like, if you want a top-tier PC, then you're going to pay a higher premium.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:39]** But if you're only playing, like...

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:40]** you know, Starcraft or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:45]** What's the rate for like a Pentium 4 to play Age of Empires 2?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:46]** Yeah.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:47]** I don't think they have that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:50]** They can do an iPad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:54]** But I do know a Discord where you can, for Age of Empires.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:57]** What's the Age of Empires sound?

**[00:07:58 - 00:08:00]** There are so many sounds that are just iconic from it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:17]** yeah the the chopping wood sound oh yeah the chopping wood the like like picking away yeah when everyone's just like cutting like a stone like uh a tower with their swords and like for some reason and somehow that actually works


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:21]** Speaking of clink-clink, I always think StarCraft when I hear those kind of things.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:26]** Coming in 5x5, and I forget what the minors would say.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:31]** I didn't play that, so I don't know.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:31]** StarCraft?

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:32]** You never played StarCraft?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:35]** No, because I was too busy playing Fear and Call of Duty.

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:37]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:38]** It was Command and Conquer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:40]** I was a Red Alert guy.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:42]** Red Alert?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:43]** Yuri's Revenge, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:44]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:46]** Generals 2 was really good.

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:46]** Yeah, it was so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:48]** That's the one with Starcraft.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:49]** Starcraft was the best.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:51]** Commander Cocker was cool.

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:52]** I did play that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:54]** Well, Starcraft is for very competitive people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:59]** And like, yeah, something about the story modes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:05]** Kelly, you should you should like enter a Starcraft tournament in Korea and just get my.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:06]** Oh, yeah, I'm sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:11]** And they do start like the original Starcraft because Starcraft 2 wasn't didn't live up to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:11]** Yeah.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:14]** Unless I have the most amazing beginner's luck for some reason.

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:17]** Dude, I could definitely see you doing that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:17]** Just Zerg Rush.

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:18]** Right, Zerg Rush.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:25]** I was going to say, the most horrible gut-wrenching sound from Age of Empires.

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:26]** Do you remember this?

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:29]** It's like... Do you remember that sound?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:31]** What sound was that?

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:32]** Age of Empires.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:37]** It's the sound of your f***ing farm needing to be replanted.

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:59]** oh yes oh it's like i'm the general i'm the general slash king of like a kingdom but i have to manually reseed my farms vampires too and you're across the map in the middle of a fight but then in red alert it's like unit lost lost


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:22]** thank you red alert thank you i need it oh i am hearing it right now i will make sure that i add it to this if we do that with that copyright please please do i think i think my favorite real-time strategy game sound was in generals when you upgraded to the ak-47s ak-47 for everyone


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:47]** that's amazing that was actually the funnest um unit i think to play was the uh i don't remember what they were called terrorist yeah so much fun i haven't played it at all so check it out yeah we'll have to we'll have to play generals together i still remember shogun total war was watching the uh the assassination videos i have shogun installed right now it is


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:49]** That's how good that game is.

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:50]** Stop recording.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:51]** We're going to play video games.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:52]** We're just going to have a shogun party.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:53]** Dude.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:57]** Because it's the best combination of strategy and then real-time battle tactics.

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:59]** And then, like, the assassination.

**[00:10:59 - 00:10:59]** Yeah, it's great.

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:00]** It's classic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:02]** Dude, all of those cut scenes were dope.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:03]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:07]** So what was the sound of the sword in Age of Empires you were saying?

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:08]** Yeah.

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:09]** What did it sound like?

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:11]** It was just like, kink, kink, kink.

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:13]** Was it a clink?

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:13]** Clink?

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:14]** Clink?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:18]** Is this a joke that is going to happen?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:21]** And that's what you hear for the best transition.

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:22]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:28]** I think if you get into the real game, Starfinder, that's how we ended last time.

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:31]** You guys found the source of the clink clink.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:34]** Dude, every time we kill someone, we have to say unit lost, okay?

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:34]** Clink clink.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:35]** Unit lost.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:36]** Unit lost.

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:37]** I'll say it for you.

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:40]** Thanks.

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:40]** Unit lost.

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:41]** You guys ready for this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:42]** Check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:43]** I'm so ready.

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:44]** Yeah.

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:44]** I don't know.

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:46]** I don't know if I'm ready for the transition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:47]** I don't think you are.

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:47]** I don't think you are.

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:49]** It was so last time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:51]** I don't want this smoke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:51 - 00:12:00]** So last time you set out to explore the halls after Thaddeus whispered about Rolu into an open mic or open comms channel.

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:01]** That's right.

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:08]** And then Chuck led the charge to find the source of the clinking while Torme kept guard in the back.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:12]** He did even set a mine up to kind of watch your guys' back.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:16]** So when Chuck got to that intersection, though...

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:23]** He turned a corner and saw a man in a lab coat turn the corner at the far end of the Western Corridor and walk away.

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:30]** You all made your way up there, and you only found a niche with a glowing cable.

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:38]** When you opened the door that was against the other wall there, you found nothing but Akatonian sand falling down on you.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:42]** And that's when Thaddeus relieved himself, and so Tremé took off to go find that clinking.

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:44]** And he found it.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:46]** He found a metallic anthropod.

**[00:12:46 - 00:13:05]** clink clink clink clink so let's roll for initiative oh wow right to it right right into it yeah dude kevin's not messing around right now which is bad that means he's really going to enjoy this fight which is that's yeah preparing for this oh wow

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:07]** I promised people on Discord, TPK.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:08]** I'm working on it.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:10]** Oh, so that way you're not soft?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:11]** Right.

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:13]** You don't have to over-correct, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:14]** Come on, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:17]** That's the only way Kev gets hard nowadays is TPK.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:18]** Can I only see myself?

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:20]** I thought I was face-to-face with somebody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:21]** You'll see in a second.

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:23]** Give me your initiative.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:24]** I don't know.

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:25]** We went face to face.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:26]** It was coming down the end of the hallway.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:26]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:27]** Oh, okay.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:31]** So I have time to duck through the corridor and retreat.

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:32]** I'm still going to avoid this fight entirely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:36]** If you rolled a high enough initiative, I think, is kind of how that works.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:38]** What did you guys get?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:40]** I got a 20, sir.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:40]** 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:44]** 20 for Thaddeus.

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:45]** The cat man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:46]** I got a 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:48]** 16 for Chalk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:59]** I got a one because although I've been focused on what's happening to Tremé, I think I can't quite see that well.

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:00]** I am the only one in the party.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:01]** It's your guilty conscience.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:03]** Sorry, what was that?

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:04]** Nothing.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:08]** There's someone in trouble and you're talking to me about who knows what.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:12]** I'm just going to mumble quietly in this corner.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:13]** That's so creepy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:15]** Please don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:17]** You're like right behind him too on the map.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:21]** So just for the listeners, we're in the Stellar Flare.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:24]** It is a matrix of corridors.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:27]** They've come back around to the front.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:30]** So we have on the far left side of the map, we have the three.

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:37]** We have Thaddeus, Chalk, and Rolu kind of bunched in the corner right around that edge of where it turns a corner.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:40]** And then we have Tremei.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:48]** has walked all the way back, and he's right at the door where the turret was above him and can see out into the desert.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:54]** And then at the opposite end, we have a security patrol bot coming in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:57]** Just to be clear, my total initiative is five.

**[00:14:58 - 00:14:59]** I rolled a one, but it's five.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:00]** Oh, you rolled a one?

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:01]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:02]** Okay, five.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:04]** It's fine, you're still last.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:04]** Sweet.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:06]** Well, it is the patrol bot's turn.

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:09]** So let me move it into view for you.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:12]** It steps to about there, I believe.

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:14]** Can you see it now, Will?

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:16]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:17]** I can't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:19]** I can't see Will.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:20]** I don't even know where Will is.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:21]** Is Will that far ahead?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:26]** He's about 60 feet, and you guys can see about 60 feet in dim light.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:27]** I can't.

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:30]** Thanks for screwing up my thing, Kevin.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:30]** What?

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:31]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:55]** maybe i just need to move my like self down that's probably why oh there we go never mind that is a 17 nope sorry let me do math on that that's a 30 to hit what are you hitting wait so you're attacking me i don't get it what are you attacking me with uh i'm shooting you with a weapon oh wow it's an energy weapon okay what what are you looking for what information


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:58]** I was just wondering if you're throwing a... It just came out of nowhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:58 - 00:15:59]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:02]** Is it like a pistol round?

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:03]** What happens?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:05]** I'll tell you in a second.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:08]** I wanted to make sure it hit before... 30 hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:11]** Unless it's a grenade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:35]** so this this this giant i wouldn't say giant it's a medium-sized creature uh this metallic anthropod kind of walks up to you clink clink clink clink and then uh there is a almost like a coil below its body so this coil below it starts to crackle and electrify and this this arc of energy hits you

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:39]** That is six points of damage.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:44]** And that's the end of that patrol bot's turn.

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:46]** Thaddeus, you're next.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:47]** Okay.

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:49]** Well, Thaddeus can't see whatever the hell this is.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:51]** He's going to walk down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:52]** So he's comfortable there.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:54]** I don't know what's going on.

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:56]** I'm just going to stay here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:56]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:57]** I know, right?

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:58]** Per tactical rules.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:59 - 00:16:59]** Okay.

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:00]** I think I see.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:03]** I'm going to put my back in front of Rolu amazingly.

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:06]** That's probably not a good idea, but I'm going to do that.

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:10]** Actually, let me move a little bit forward to not get stabbed in the back.

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:12]** 5, 10, 15, 20.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:18]** Yeah, I could probably... Sorry, what are you mumbling?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:20]** I think Rolo gets an attack of opportunity though, right?

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:20]** I do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:25]** So then he's going to take out...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:26]** Oh, my God.

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:27]** I don't want this show.

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:28]** Not yet.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:28]** Not yet.

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:33]** So I'm going to... All right, so he's going to shoot with his Venomcaster.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:37]** Classic Thaddeus move for... It doesn't hit.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:41]** It's like an eight to attack, which doesn't hit, I'm sure.

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:42]** So there you go.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:47]** I moved ahead of Rulu, and I'm safely out of dodge from him.

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:48]** And that's where I'm at right now.

**[00:17:48 - 00:18:09]** beautiful great turn uh thank you wait wait wait wait wait wait kevin i'm gonna do like a check of some kind though can i do like a life science check or something even though it's a metallic uh you could try a life science check but that probably wouldn't do any good um what you could do is engineering i can't do that yeah life science for sure won't work huh no it is not a living creature


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:11]** Alright, I see that.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:14]** In fact, it says it's an unliving creature.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:16]** I'll give you that one for free.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:19]** It looks like it's not alive.

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:21]** Metallic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:23]** It's a security bot.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:26]** It just zaps me with this coil thing.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:28]** I don't know about it, though.

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:31]** I'll have to wait until it's my turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:34]** I think the definition of unliving in this sense is it's not sentient.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:36]** It doesn't have a soul.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:38]** Where an android is living,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:41]** Someone couldn't do a mind thrust against it, for example.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:43]** Do you have mind thrusts?

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:44]** I don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:49]** I'm just referencing Power Pack 2.0, which is going to be released soon, I think.

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:51]** Or probably did get released.

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:54]** So check that out on Emergency Power Pod where we guest start on there.

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:56]** Fun times.

**[00:18:57 - 00:18:59]** That was a discussion that came up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:01]** I'm done, man.

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:02]** I don't know about the mind thrust thing.

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:03]** I'm going to assume no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:05]** You can't, basically, I'm pretty sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:10]** Because there's not a mind to thrust against.

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:11]** That's right.

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:14]** You can thrust against other things, though, but just not the mind.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:19]** You can still thrust against it, it's just not going to have any effect.

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:21]** That sucks, though.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:25]** I mean, thrust to your heart's content, but...

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:26]** Until you're satisfied.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:30]** Please stop mentally humping my robot.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:33]** I don't see where it says it's mindless, but that would make sense.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:34]** Okay, moving on.

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:35]** Chuck, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:45]** Um, I'm going to toddle 30 feet toward where I saw the strobe and Thaddeus's bones glowing through his body.

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:56]** And I'm going to see if I can do anything with an engineering, maybe computers check to deduce what this thing is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:57]** Maybe a weakness.

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:59]** Uh, I mean, I'm sorry.

**[00:19:59 - 00:19:59]** I'm not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:28]** versed enough i'm pretty sure it's just engineering cool engineering it is 14 does 14 get me anything yeah i should have calculated this uh i think it gives you one thing what do you want to know is what's it vulnerable to oh vulnerabilities you want one or both both i'll give you just one duh it is it is vulnerable to electricity if two's on the menu i'll take two all right cool electricity's uh hey hey guys it can deal but it can't take try hitting it with electricity


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:30]** Yes.

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:31]** Fascinating.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:36]** Identify creatures is an engineering... Yes, it is.

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:37]** Identify constructs.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:37]** Yes.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:38]** And this is a construct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:39]** Cool.

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:40]** That's my whole turn.

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:41]** I wish I had electric anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:42]** That was your whole turn?

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:43]** Moved and did engineering?

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:44]** You didn't want to do anything else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:45]** That was a move and an action.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:46]** I mean, I could...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:51]** You could pop a shot off with a disadvantage.

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:53]** But that would be a lot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:54]** It would be a lot.

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:58]** I'm going to double move to Thaddeus' shoulder.

**[00:20:58 - 00:21:00]** If Thaddeus consents.

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:00]** Yeah.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:02]** Of course.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:03]** Climb on up.

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:06]** There we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:11]** It is now... Pots and kettles, my dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:15]** I think we should somehow trap this thing and destroy it.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:18]** I got pretty hurt last time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:28]** And, um... So, Termaine's going to... Can I first, like, maybe just do an engineering check to see if I can find out what the other vulnerability is?

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:29]** Or whatever?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:30]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:31]** Okay.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:32]** I got a 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:32]** Ooh!

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:33]** Let's see.

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:35]** Okay, so the actual CR on that... I have to do math in my head.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:37]** Okay.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:37]** Do-do-do-do-do.

**[00:21:39 - 00:22:03]** okay uh 20 i'll give you two things so the other vulnerability is critical hits so yeah well hi guys um and then what else do you want to know um is there anything that i can do to defend myself like is there any what like what's there to know sorry what um like you want to know what kind of cool attack that i can like have a strategy against or like

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:12]** I will give you, I'll give you one is you recognize that that coil thing underneath it is an integrated tactical emitter.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:17]** It shoots electricity and it does 1d4 plus 4 damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:20]** Okay, so it's weak to electricity and it shoots electricity is what we know, right?

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:21]** Yeah.

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:21]** Okay.

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:21]** Yep.

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:22]** Cool.

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:23]** Interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:23]** Okay.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:24]** All right.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:25]** Now what are you going to do, Treme?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:26]** That was all free rounds.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:32]** I'm going to double check something in my notes real quick.

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:33]** Hold on a moment.

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:36]** Kevin, while he's doing that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:39]** Middle of combat, he's pulling out his...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:42]** My one elbow sink.

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:51]** I just wanted to make sure that there wasn't an electricity elemental I could just conjure.

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:53]** Like an electrovore, perhaps?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:55]** You have four arms.

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:59]** One of your four arms should have the quarterback flip-up rulebook.

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:03]** Oh my god.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:05]** The playbook for the spell.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:07]** Which warping?

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:09]** Kelly, what was your question?

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:10]** I'll wait until my turn.

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:11]** Go ahead, Will.


## Speaker_0

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:11]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:19]** So I am going to cast a hazard, which is just a minor cantrip.

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:21]** Spell gains.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:32]** So I summon a minor hazard from an alternate reality, creating a splash of acid or blast of freezing air or a static electricity charge.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:33]** Nice.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:34]** Electric charge.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:35]** That's cool.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:36]** So, yeah.

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:41]** 1d3, not a lot, but it'll probably go through, right?

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:44]** So maybe that's worth it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:48]** So you can cast this at a distance, and you have a 5-foot square that you put it on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:52]** When you cast the spell, spell DC is 13.

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:54]** I don't know.

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:55]** What's the range?

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:57]** It doesn't say.

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:59]** When you cast the spell, choose...

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:02]** Acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic.

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:07]** The spell gains that descriptor, so I'm choosing electricity.

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:11]** Each creature in the area must succeed at a reflex save.

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:15]** Oh, so everyone has to do a reflex save, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:17]** Well, what is the area?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:19]** I'm going to start the timer on this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:19]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:24]** Like I said, the range I'm seeing is 25 feet plus 5 feet for two levels.

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:26]** It's a 5-foot radius burst.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:27]** Okay, so that makes sense.

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:33]** You're doing basically a 10-foot square, you're right, because it's five foot from the corner.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:34]** Radius.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:35]** Yeah.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:40]** So you get to pick four squares, all congruent, is that the word?

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:45]** That are at least 25, or up to 25 plus five for every level away from you.

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:46]** So you could drop it right on top of the... Every two levels.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:47]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:48]** Okay, so 30 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:49]** You could drop it 30 feet.

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:50]** Easy.

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:52]** I could drop it more than 30 feet.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:53]** I could drop it like 50 feet, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:54]** But that'd be silly.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:55]** Why would you put it behind it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:59]** I don't think you can drop it more than 30 feet.

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:00]** What level are we?

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:00]** You're three.

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:03]** So it's five feet for every two levels.

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:06]** It's 25 feet plus five feet for every two levels.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:07]** So it's 30 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:09]** Well, I'm dropping it here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:09]** Perfect.

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:10]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:11]** And it is a DC what?

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:14]** 13 for half, I think.

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:15]** For fortitude, reflex?

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:19]** Each creature in the area, reflex save or take 1d3 damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:23]** That is a 14 on the die.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:25]** So what is the damage it takes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:26]** Nothing.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:27]** There's no damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:28]** It negates it completely?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:30]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:33]** Okay, but now every time it moves in that square, the hazard stays, right?

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:34]** For how long?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:38]** I believe... One round.

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:40]** It's probably for one round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:42]** Oh, interesting.

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:43]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:48]** So if you move, I guess, in your turn, maybe that would make sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:49]** Yeah, that'd be fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:51]** Okay.

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:55]** And then by the start of my next turn, then it would be gone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:55]** Sounds good.

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:56]** Let's do it.

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:56]** Okay.

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:58]** That is either your turn then or you're going to move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:58 - 00:25:59]** And then I'm going to move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:00]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:01]** Because I still have a move action.

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:02]** I'm going to retreat.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:05]** And I'm going to go this way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:06]** Interesting.

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:07]** He's going to run out the door.

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:11]** Out through the guarded... Through the scanner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:11]** The scanner, yeah.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:12]** That's what I was looking for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:19]** Maybe we trap him in the scanner and hotwire this thing and fry its cortex.

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:20]** I don't know.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:22]** Lure it in here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:22]** All right.

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:24]** Rolu, what are you going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:33]** Volo is going to take a five foot step forward and going to say, Thaddeus, you really need to think about lines of sight here.

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:41]** And I'm going to take a shot at this creature.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:45]** And I'm just wondering if I... So I don't have any range penalties because my range is 100 feet.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:46]** It's only 80 feet away from me.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:48]** But I'm looking down a dark hallway.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:50]** Is there any darkness penalties, Kev?

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:51]** What's going on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:52]** So we are in dim light.

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:54]** All of the solar flare right now is in dim light.

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:54]** Okay.

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:56]** And you have normal vision, right?

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:58]** So you're the only one that's affected.

**[00:26:58 - 00:27:00]** And what it does is gives you a 20% concealment chance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:01]** 20% mischance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:03]** The other... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:04]** So I got to roll it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:05]** It gives everybody else a 20%.

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:06]** Yeah.

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:07]** You roll it.

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:08]** I can roll it.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:09]** It don't matter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:12]** Well, I think technically I'm supposed to roll it, but down to do whatever you want.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:12]** Right?

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:13]** Because it's like a hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:14]** Roll stuff.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:14]** Okay.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:15]** Roll stuff, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:15]** All right.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:16]** Roll it.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:17]** Rolling.

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:18]** Rolling.

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:19]** We're rolling.

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:25]** It's going to be a 19 against EAC.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:26]** Ah!

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:49]** okay sweet so that's a hit it's a hit okay i'm gonna roll uh d100 and i got a 19 yes no i got a uh i guess a 100 right because one to 100 so yeah i got a 100 so i'm good nice you're good okay so it hits and what kind of weapon are you shooting it is a laser

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:51]** It is a laser that does fire damage.

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:53]** Yes.

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:58]** And that is going to be a really solid six points of fire damage to this creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:59 - 00:27:59]** All right.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:01]** Six points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:01]** Yes.

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:05]** And that's my turn, because I just realized I should have moved further up, but I can't move.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:06]** Shoot, move.

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:07]** So that's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:08]** Shoot it.

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:12]** It just plinks off the armor, but there's definitely a scar.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:13]** You can see it.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:20]** Well, you can't, but everybody else can see this burn mark along the carapace of this.

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:21]** Metallic Anthropod.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:23]** We're going to go back to the top.

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:24]** It is round number two.

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:29]** The patrol bot gets to go, and it is going to move forward.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:33]** Let me see here one second.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:35]** Check my ranges.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:37]** Okay.

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:40]** It's going to march forward right to the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:40]** How dare you march?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:44]** And as it does that, he has to roll reflex save, correct?

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:46]** He misses this time.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:48]** You got a five on the die.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:50]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:51]** So go ahead and roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:53]** So one point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:56]** One point, but it is critical because it's electricity, right?

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:57]** So you get 50% of that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:57 - 00:29:00]** I don't know the rules on it, but yeah, it's electricity damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:06]** you get 50% plus whatever the, or 50%, additional 50% of the damage that you deal.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:10]** So since it's one, you take half of that and then add it.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:12]** So yeah, two points of damage.

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:13]** Cool.

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:15]** Uh, at least something did something.

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:25]** Uh, but it is now that the patrol bot is going to then do jolting arc.

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:30]** Uh, so let me just roll this thing to see how long it's going to take to go the next time.

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:30]** So that's,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:34]** Okay, I have a question about the equipment here.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:35]** What equipment?

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:37]** The equipment I have nearby.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:39]** Okay, let's wait until your turn to do that.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:40]** Okay.

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:45]** So, this creature stepped up.

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:49]** It is then going to burst out in electricity.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:53]** In all directions, I believe.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:57]** It says you can hit up to four creatures within 40 feet.

**[00:29:58 - 00:29:59]** Oh, come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:01]** It looks like you guys are all... Not Rolo, except Rolo.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:04]** Rolo's not within 40 feet, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:07]** One caveat is they have to be no more than 30 feet apart.

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:11]** So, let's check the distance between Tremay and Chalk and... Ooh!

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:13]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:15]** Someone's 35 feet.

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:17]** You are 35 feet away.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:20]** So I can only target the two of you instead of all three.

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:23]** So I'm going to need you to give me a reflex save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:26]** Which two of us?

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:31]** Termay is just out of range for the robot to attack all three.

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:32]** Wow.

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:41]** So instead of going for the closer one, which would be Termay, the robot's going to go after the furthest ones, which are two people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:46]** I was actually going to argue that he doesn't have line of sight on Termay.

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:46]** It's true.

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:47]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:49]** I'd say that's partial.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:51]** He's literally around a corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:52]** I don't think he has line of sight.

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:55]** If you were to give me a shot right now, trying to shoot through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:56]** He'd have to do some witch warping.

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:58]** I'm hitting this corner, man.

**[00:30:58 - 00:31:00]** Like bullet bending stuff in order to get him, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:00]** Yeah.

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:01]** What are we watching?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:04]** What's that movie with Angelina Jolie?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:09]** I guarantee there's no way for... Anyway, this is a good point because we're arguing about nothing.

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:09]** Wanted.

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:11]** We're not wanted.

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:13]** Chuck at a 19 for his reflex save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:13]** The movie Wanted.

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:17]** That's when he shoots the gun and spins the bullet and it curves around the wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:17]** That's what I mean.

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:17]** James McAvoy.

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:20]** This is not that... Yeah, James McAvoy.

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:20]** This is not that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:22]** Oh, but I was just saying that's the movie.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:30]** No, in this case, it was going to target the most number of characters it could hit, and that's what it did because there's two instead of one, so...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:57]** all right so what did you guys roll for your saves fair enough well shock got a 20 apparently 19 i need a reflex save from both of you no 19 19 fantastic that's good for a shock i'm very happy but i got a four it's not oh okay so chalk you take only one point of damage but kelly you take three do the math on that right because because half would be routed down to one correct yeah okay that's right all right taking that damage right yeah

**[00:31:57 - 00:31:58]** Right?

**[00:31:58 - 00:31:58]** Bam!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:00]** And that is the end of the turn.

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:03]** The ground just kind of charges.

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:08]** And it is now Thaddeus' turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:10]** Thaddeus is like, hmm.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:13]** And then he like he's going to switch out his.

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:14]** Yes.

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:16]** Very good.

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:17]** I wish I came up with that.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:18]** Shocking.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:21]** He's going to switch to the auto target rifle.

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:24]** So he just does like one of those cool like.

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:27]** I was trying to reference some video game where you're constantly switching weapons.

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:30]** Well, we were talking about LAN parties like.

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:31]** Call of Duty?

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:32]** Counter-Strike.

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:34]** Counter-Strike.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:35]** CSGO.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:39]** Yeah, he does a CSGO move behind his back, and now he has an auto-target rifle out.

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:43]** That was a move action, so he can only shoot once this round, which he will do.

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:46]** And hopefully it will be good this time.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:49]** Oh my god, it's an 8.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:50]** I'm rolling so poorly.

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:52]** That's too bad.

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:53]** Yeah, it is too bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:54]** And that's your whole turn?

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:56]** Yeah.

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:57]** I'm so sad.

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:57]** Great.

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:58]** Okay, moving on.

**[00:32:58 - 00:33:00]** Chalk, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:01]** Great.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:02]** There will be blood today.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:11]** Chalk is actually going to, having seen Thaddeus switch to a weapon with a longer reach.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:12]** Oh, that's a good idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:18]** So he holsters his light asphalt blaster and switches to his hunting rifle.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:20]** Hmm.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:24]** which has a little bit longer reach and pulls the trigger.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:24]** Very nice.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:27]** That's a 16 to hit.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:29]** Ooh, EAC or KAC?

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:30]** Whichever one's lower.

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:31]** Is that true?

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:33]** No.

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:34]** No.

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:37]** It's... I think it's KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:38]** That is a miss, then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:42]** It's a projectile weapon that does piercing damage, so yeah, it's a KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:52]** Yeah, and so if it was electricity, it would have absorbed into the body of this thing, of any kind of EAC, but it wasn't, so it just plings off.

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:52]** Clink.

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:53]** Didn't have enough energy.

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:54]** Just skimmed it.

**[00:33:55 - 00:34:02]** It is now Termay's turn, and just for that, we're going to get rid of your square of hazards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:25]** yep uh and i'm gonna just cast it again nice and then uh can i is it possible because i'm not moving right if can i double attack but like delay part of my attack i don't think you can do this i guess i can't cast a spell and a fire weapon right no yeah okay yeah i'll just put the hazard down


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:26]** Put it down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:27]** Okay.

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:27]** Put it down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:30]** And I have to do a save for that, right?

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:31]** A reflex save?

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:32]** Yeah.

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:33]** I pass that reflex save.

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:34]** And is it?

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:35]** Yeah.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:35]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:37]** For hazard, is it every time you're?

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:37]** No.

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:44]** I was going to cast it here for when you go into your enter it next turn.

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:48]** So, like, you would potentially, if you were going through this, get it twice.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:50]** But I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:53]** It says each creature in the area must succeed a reflex save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:55]** So I'm assuming... That's probably just once.

**[00:34:56 - 00:35:00]** I don't think it creates a hazard beyond a round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:06]** I think if you casted it one square over so that he was in it, then it would... It was in it.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:07]** Anyways, do what you want.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:08]** Moving on.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:09]** Unless you're going to move?

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:10]** Are you going to move too?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:10]** Yeah.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:18]** No, I was going to... I'll go around the corner so that I'm not lighting a sight, but I can still keep an eye on the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:19]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:25]** If he goes through this square, I'll take a shot at him.

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:29]** If he presents a target.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:30]** Rolu, what are you up to?

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:33]** Wait, did the creature take damage or did it pass its reflex?

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:34]** It passed.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:59]** I think Rolu, if anybody who can see in the dark probably just sees his shoulders relax as he aims and is going to take two shots because after that second bright burst of electricity and then now with this area effect, then that's lit up and Rolu's going to take two shots hoping that the increased visibility briefly can help him hit


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:29]** this fucking patrol bot uh first shot is a 10 which i think probably misses against eac that missed next shot is a nine so does not so you're like i think i have a clear shot and then like the lightning or the the electricity kind of fades and you don't see anything and you're just shooting right dark yeah yeah you hear all the way down the hallway uh all right and i think that's the end of that round we're going to round number three it is a patrol bot's turn again

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:34]** And this time, they are going to use their other weapon.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:40]** That coil then charges up and is going to fire at Thaddeus.

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:44]** And that's going to be 29 to hit.

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:46]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:47]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:47]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:50]** Throw it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:54]** That is five points of electricity damage.


## Speaker_0

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:54]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:57]** What's the range on that particular attack?

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:58]** 40?

**[00:36:59 - 00:36:59]** The range is 3?

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:00]** 30?

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:00]** 4D?

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:01]** 4D?

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:02]** Ah, okay.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:05]** Wow, you're saying you're not in range?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:05]** Are you trying to...

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:06]** No, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:09]** I'm not going to do some Kevin stuff.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:12]** I'm just literally just curious for the future.

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:14]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:15]** Oh, my bad.

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:15]** It's only 15.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:16]** Shoot.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:17]** You're right.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:20]** You're right.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:21]** Wait a second.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:25]** I wasn't even enraged when I was getting attacked.

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:26]** Did you take damage that time?

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:27]** Yeah, I did.

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:29]** I took six points of damage.

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:30]** Oh, my God.

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:30]** Okay.

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:31]** No, wait.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:31]** Yes.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:34]** Then you take your six points of damage back just because I'm being fair.

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:36]** But it can still move.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:39]** So it's going to move to be within 15 feet of you.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:41]** It then is going to do a save.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:44]** And it fails.

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:46]** So it takes three points of damage.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:47]** All right.

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:47]** Roll the damage for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:49]** For your area effect.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:50]** D3.

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:52]** Plus the hazard?

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:54]** Plus the electricity thing, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:54 - 00:38:04]** Yeah, plus he's vulnerable to electricity, so that's going to be... Okay, so I got a... If I roll a D, it's a 1D3, and I roll a 4, that's a 2, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:06]** How do you roll a 4 on a D3?

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:07]** On a D6.

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:08]** That's how you roll a D3?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:11]** How do you have a D3?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:11]** Yes.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:14]** 1, 2 is 1, 3, 4 is 2, 5, 6 is 3.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:15]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:15]** So what did you roll?

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:16]** 2.

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:20]** Okay, so that's 2 plus... I rolled a 4...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:23]** So that's two points.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:24]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:27]** And it's also electricity damage, so it gets an additional point.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:29]** So it has three points of damage total.

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:31]** Nice.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:33]** But now it's going to do the attack on Kelly.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:36]** It hits, and you take five points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:37]** Wait, which attack?

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:39]** That attack that you just did, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:42]** That I rolled prior to moving, but I'm moving it.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:43]** And you just rolled again.

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:45]** I'm not going to roll it all again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:45]** Oh, but you could do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:47]** No, I didn't just roll again.

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:48]** Okay, all right, fine.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:49]** It hits you.

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:49]** Take five points.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:50]** Moving on.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:51]** Fine.

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:52]** Thaddeus, it's your turn.

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:53]** What are you going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:57]** All right, so Thaddeus is going to move far away from this guy, 40 feet away or more than that.

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:00]** Okay.

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:10]** She's going to run past Rolu slightly because he can do that because he has a really long-range weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:14]** I love that it's not just Rolu.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:15]** It's everything John says.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:16]** You're like, shut up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:22]** I mean, I said that as Rolu, but yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:25]** Oh my god.

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:29]** And John, you better not say anything after what just happened right now.

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:35]** But I don't land an attack with my auto-target rifle.

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:35]** It just doesn't hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:38]** So then you put me in... Shut up!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:40]** Are you mumbling again behind me?

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:40]** No.

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:41]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:41 - 00:40:08]** what oh i saw i was listening to someone else but it didn't hit just just to be fair to me it does not say the range of this weapon in the book you have to actually go look at the weapon it's 60 feet my life my life oh you mean his his weapons 15 feet and i have i have multiple weapons so like that yes that that weapon is only 15 the other the other is 40 uh okay it is now the arc one is 40 wow


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:34]** anyways uh chuck what are you doing i saw you rode with him so you lose your move you're 30 feet away yep this is a stand and bang fight i think i'm just gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna spend my move action like you mentioned to stay on thaddeus's shoulder uh then when he stops uh he's gonna take careful aim uh and you see like the the through the camera like it gets really quiet all you hear is chuck's

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:39]** Let's see if he hits.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:42]** Natural 20, baby.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:44]** There it is.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:44]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:45]** That's what we're talking about.

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:46]** Glorious.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:48]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:51]** And as I said, this thing is vulnerable to critical hits, so let's do it.

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:53]** Maybe you can one-shot it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:54]** So I should roll four d8s?

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:57]** No, it's 150%.

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:57]** Right.

**[00:40:58 - 00:41:02]** So I roll twice the damage for the crit, and then it takes 150% of whatever twice the damage was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:03]** Exactly.

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:03]** Yes.

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:05]** Do we do the crit card, too?

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:31]** yes uh if a crit card is on the menu and i always forget the rules of the crit cards so the crit card basically like if you have a crit bonus attached to it like if it does like burn damage or whatever yeah that drops away and you're using the crit card instead am i am i right i mean you can do it however you want there's a suggestion what no i want to know what it says what is the rule classic uh it's it's like the pirates i don't know the rule okay

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:33]** Okay, so I'll give you double the damage.

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:36]** You roll twice and add your bonuses twice.

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:37]** Okay.

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:43]** And then we'll do the crit card instead of your crit effect, if you have one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:43]** Gotcha.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:44]** So that's seven.

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:46]** I don't have a crit effect.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:48]** So give me the card.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:53]** Just confirming that the card says that you don't add the card and the crit effect.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:55]** You can do one or the other.

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:57]** I'm just going to do a quick shuffle.

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:57]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:57 - 00:42:04]** But the crit effect, though, for the bot's vulnerability isn't being challenged.

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:05]** No, that's a vulnerability.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:07]** Crit effect would have been like burn.

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:09]** So you did seven points of damage total?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:10]** Yes.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:11]** That's the double damage?

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:12]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:12]** Rolled a five and a two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:14]** Hold on.

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:15]** Five and a two, so that's seven.

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:17]** And then what is half of seven?

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:18]** That's going to be three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:19]** Three, so it's ten total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:21]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:26]** Okay.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:26]** All right.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:26]** And... Stop.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:27]** Sorry, sorry, sorry.

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:27]** Ready?

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:29]** Three, two, one, go.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:30]** Go.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:31]** Okay.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:33]** I don't know when you told me to stop.

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:33]** All right, read it off.

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:36]** Is it... It's kinetic, right?

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:36]** Yes.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:37]** Cool.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:37]** Yes.

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:42]** That is...

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:47]** Wait, is this... Oh, it's not electric damage.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:48]** It's just strike kinetic, right?

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:49]** Cool.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:50]** Bonus effect, bleed.

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:52]** 1d6 per 5 levels.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:53]** Ooh.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:56]** Too bad this thing does not have... It's a construct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:57]** Ah.

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:58]** Yeah.

**[00:42:58 - 00:42:58]** Nicked an artery.

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:02]** You sure you didn't nick, like, a little tube oil?

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:03]** A fuel line.

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:04]** Fluid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:05]** I like pneumatic.

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:07]** Its back leg starts to limp a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:07]** Yeah.

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:08]** I'll take that.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:09]** It's bleeding hydraulic fluid.

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:14]** I mean, who's to say that a robot doesn't have a circulatory system?

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:14]** I think it does.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:18]** I would argue that most robots do, especially kinetic robots.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:19]** And for that matter, maybe they have mines.

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:22]** Plus, the effect is bleed and not leak.

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:23]** It would be a leak effect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:31]** Well, you could have, you bleed your brakes, for instance, when you're, like, bleeding is a, if you were talking, getting technical.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:34]** In some cultures, bleeding and leaking is used interchangeably.

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:35]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:38]** Well, moving on, that's going to be Turn Shock.

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:40]** Torme, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:45]** So, I presume this is the baddie here.

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:46]** Say again?

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:48]** It went around the corner, right?

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:49]** Or it went past me?

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:50]** Yes.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:51]** Okay.

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:53]** So, and can I currently see it?

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:58]** Like, can I shoot through this like a, you know...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:00]** What I'll say is there's a piece of glass there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:02]** Like a sniper hole?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:06]** There's a piece of glass there that you have a chance to shoot through.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:11]** So, like, if you were shooting an energy weapon, like a laser, it would go through the glass.

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:14]** But if you're shooting a kinetic weapon, I'm going to say that they get partial cover.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:16]** Or not partial.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:16]** Is it partial cover?

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:19]** I have terrible cover rules.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:23]** So there's no, like, this isn't like a loophole, like, you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:24]** What's a loophole?

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:25]** What kind of loophole are you looking for?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:47]** when you're or their way for like to shoot a weapon without being seen like roll a stealth check and then shoot yeah like through through the open whatever it's fine i'll just uh step up and then shoot through the i'll i'll walk up here mosey on up okay so you walk up into the scanner area

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:53]** Yeah, I want to be in the scanner to have some sort of cover from the scanner, if possible.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:56]** That's my intent, if you'll allow that.

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:59]** I just want to make sure that we did.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:04]** Like, I assume this is, like, an industrial scanner for, like, the facility, right?

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:05]** Like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:08]** That is the scanner that activates the turret.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:11]** So I'm making sure you guys deactivated that.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:15]** Otherwise, the turret would also come down and strike you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:18]** We disabled it for a given amount of time, I think.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:21]** But I don't remember how long that time was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:23]** I thought we disabled it, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:25]** You all passed it, and then you disabled the turret.

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:33]** I'm pretty sure you guys, yeah, you did an injury check and basically disconnected the scanner, so that turret does not come back on.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:33]** Okay.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:38]** Would have been real bad if you were like, oh, I'm going to walk through and then come back in, and then the turret also comes down and kills you.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:39]** Go, that would have got my TPK.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:40]** Sorry, so what are you doing?

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:43]** You stepped up, you ended up taking a shot?

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:43]** What are you shooting?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:48]** Yeah, I was going to take a shot with the tactical semi-auto.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:48]** Okay.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:49]** Okay.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:50]** Okay.

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:50]** Okay.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:51]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:51 - 00:46:16]** okay cool and i got a 22 to hit nice that hit that hits nice 19 on the deck oh and max damage seven points oh seven points but as a kinetic weapon just checking uh yeah it's a semi-auto pistol all right uh man piercing damage that is the end of tremendous turn rolu what are you doing to me


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:36]** Rolloo is going to just they plant their feet breathe out take another two shots at this creature from right where they are trying to ignore the fact that Thaddeus ran by them

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:39]** First attack is going to be a seven.

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:43]** And Rolu is regretting his haste of trying to shoot twice.

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:47]** My next attack, however, is a 20.

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:48]** Dirty.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:49]** Ooh.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:50]** Does that hit against EAC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:51]** That'll hit.

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:52]** Oh, it does.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:53]** That'll hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:54]** All right.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:56]** So you see the shot.

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:57]** First shot misses.

**[00:46:57 - 00:47:05]** And in the light of the first shot, Rolu corrects and is going to aim, breathe out with the last breath.

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:30]** fire for nine points of fire damage against this robot and then turn and look and in what he can make out the dim light of chak going to say between the two i think you might want to choose my shoulder and then turns back to look at the robot it's it's too late man you can't you can't shade it's too late

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:33]** So that's nine points of fire damage to the robot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:35]** Oh, man.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:37]** I like Ralu grasping at straws.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:39]** That was a good round for you guys.

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:41]** That was beautiful.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:43]** I was like, pew, pew, pew, clink, clink, clink, clink.

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:45]** Pew, pew, pew.

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:46]** Very Michael Bay-ish.

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:49]** And this thing is like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:56]** Can I just say that I want to see Kev narrating scene by scene a Michael Bay movie.

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:59]** That sounds terrible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:01]** I want you to narrate like Bad Boys.

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:03]** Can we add that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:10]** That'll be a Patreon goal right below admitting I'm a murder bot and getting an island.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:10]** Yes.

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:12]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:13]** I forgot that number one is us getting an island.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:17]** Ping, ping, pew, pew, pow, pow, pow, bang.

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:19]** And this thing is this.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:21]** Michael Bay has told.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:27]** This poor bot now, it's stumbling along.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:32]** It's got this weird leak in the back that you guys try to say is bleed, but it's just a leak.

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:37]** Its carapace is shattered all across the back end of it where you guys have been taking pot shots at it.

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:41]** It looks like a sign on the side of a highway in a redneck neighborhood.

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:43]** What you got against redneck neighborhoods?

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:45]** They shoot signs, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:46]** Is that a real thing?

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:48]** Have you ever been to one of these neighborhoods, Kev?

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:48]** Yeah.

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:51]** Or is this just like you saw... I've seen shot up signs before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:53]** I'm talking about like Muscovy, California.

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:56]** If you live there and you listen to this, I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:59]** Didn't you grow up in San Bernardino or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:00]** Where was it again?

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:02]** Yes, I grew up in... Where don't they shoot signs?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:05]** It's a place where there's nothing to do, so they shoot signs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:06]** What would you have them shoot?

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:07]** Yeah, right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:14]** Anyways, so this poor machine is crumpling over and it almost stumbles and sits down.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:19]** And then there's almost like a black foam that comes out of each of those holes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:25]** And it gets like dragged into the void.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:26]** Yeah, hopefully.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:28]** And it blows up.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:31]** Which is transformed into its next form.

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:32]** This is rad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:34]** Can I, like, make a route?

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:35]** Can I leave?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:36]** Can I?

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:37]** Can I leave?

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:38]** Out of turn now.

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:41]** Can I just run away and leave Akiton entirely?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:43]** Is this the construct version of monologuing?

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:45]** Like, what's happening here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:49]** What I was doing was nanite repair.

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:52]** So all those wounds are self-healing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:52]** Shit.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:54]** I was afraid of that.

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:55]** Yikes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:55 - 00:50:00]** And it gained back some hit points, and that was its full turn, though.

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:02]** So it is now Thaddeus' turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:08]** Okay, so do I know roughly what the KAC is based on our previous stuff?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:09]** I don't know.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:09]** Do you?

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:09]** Anyone know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:11]** Anyone hazard to throw out a general guess?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:14]** Are you asking if anyone else has been keeping track of that?

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:16]** I'm not going to tell you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:17]** Something less than 20.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:17]** Okay.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:18]** All right.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:19]** In that case.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:20]** All right.

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:20]** Cool.

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:24]** So I'm going to do a full action to pop off two shots Thaddeus's.

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:26]** Thaddeus got creeped out by Rulu's comment.

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:27]** He just kind of shivers it off, though.

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:30]** And that's not going to hit.

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:34]** And then that is going to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:35]** Kelly, you always just assume it's not going to hit.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:36]** Tell us the numbers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:39]** It's not going to hit because I've literally been rolling an eight.

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:39]** Only.

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:40]** Every single round.

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:43]** So if they hadn't hit the first time, there's no way.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:44]** For my first attack.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:44]** Okay.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:46]** For my second one, it's an 18.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:47]** Does that hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:48]** Please hit.

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:53]** 18 matches, and Ty goes to the roller, so that is a hit.

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:54]** There it is.

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:54]** Yeah.

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:54]** There it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:55]** Finally.

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:58]** Eight points of damage piercing.

**[00:50:59 - 00:50:59]** Yeah.

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:01]** Eight points of damage.

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:02]** KAC is 18.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:04]** That is like, finally, finally, yes!

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:06]** It's like the shot comes out, and you just like...

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:07]** Oh, he's so happy.

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:09]** Sorry, I interrupted you.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:10]** What'd you say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:13]** Great.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:14]** That was beautiful.

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:15]** Chuck, you're up.

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:16]** What's up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:17]** It was just enough to kill him.

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:18]** Oh, no.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:18]** I guess not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:19]** No.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:22]** It was almost enough to take out the Danobite repair damage.

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:23]** Almost.

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:23]** Almost.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:26]** Shaq is going... Oh, man.

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:27]** What rule number was it?

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:29]** I really love Zombieland.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:35]** There's something about Woody Harrelson and Jesse Eisenberg together in a cast that's just... Are you watching Zombieland right now?

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:36]** Is that what's happening?

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:39]** This is going to make sense in about eight seconds.

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:42]** Shaq is going to follow rule number two and double tap.

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:43]** Fire it twice.

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:45]** Yeah.

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:45]** There you go.

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:46]** With his hunting rifle.

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:48]** Boom, boom.

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:49]** So that is...

**[00:51:49 - 00:52:14]** a nine and an 18 oh 18 does hit there it is yes which i realized mathematically was a terrible idea because it's a straight d20 roll but here we are it worked out it did that's amazing at least once it's amazing and that's five piercing damage five piercing damage clink nanobytes gone


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:16]** Well, it still has nanobytes.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:18]** The nanobytes are internal to it.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:22]** The nanobytes came out, repaired it, and then went back in.

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:23]** So it's no longer bleeding either.

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:25]** It could be a module you could attack.

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:27]** Because it was never bleeding.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:29]** Because it doesn't bleed.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:29]** All right.

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:31]** That was cool, Chuck.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:32]** Tremay.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:34]** What are you doing, Tremay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:41]** I'm going to shoot at it again, but I'm going to do it from a distance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:46]** And Jermaine's going to kind of just dart across the corner.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:50]** We can get to there, I believe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:53]** So you're going to move up and around the corner going past the bot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:59]** I'm going to basically play monkey in the middle with this bot.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:02]** And I'm going to pop off a shot.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:03]** All right.

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:07]** With the tactical natural 20.

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:07]** Yes.

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:09]** This is what I'm talking about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:09]** Oh.

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:11]** This is what I'm talking about.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:12]** All right.

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:13]** You want your card?

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:13]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:16]** Or do you want the critical effect?

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:18]** The tactical semi-auto.

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:19]** Yeah, let's do it.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:20]** Card it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:21]** Card it is.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:21]** All right.

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:23]** I'm going to do a quick.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:25]** All right.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:26]** Quick little.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:29]** And then I'm going to do one, two.

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:30]** I'm going to do thin to win, man.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:33]** Just go like your first little shot.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:34]** Got it.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:35]** Just a skosh.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:36]** There.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:38]** Just a skoosh.

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:39]** All right, what's the damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:39]** Thin to win.

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:41]** What's your damage?

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:42]** I roll twice, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:44]** You roll twice and add your bonuses twice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:47]** Okay, so the first one was a six.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:47]** Hold on.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:49]** This is unfortunate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:50]** Second one was a five.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:58]** That is 11 on the dice plus one.

**[00:53:58 - 00:54:00]** So 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:01]** So here's the thing.

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:02]** 13.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:05]** It does say low blow, normal damage.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:07]** Because this is kinetic, right?

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:08]** Tactical semi-auto.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:08]** Yeah.

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:09]** Yeah.

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:12]** So normal damage, not double damage.

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:14]** But the bonus... That's a crit effect?

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:20]** Yes, but the bonus effect is that the target is sickened for two to four rounds, which I don't know if constructs can be sickened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:22]** Constructs do not get sickened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:24]** Can we just not do this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:28]** That's a GM call if you want to... You chose to do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:29]** You chose it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:33]** There is no other... What was the thing that I was choosing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:37]** The trade-off was doing a normal... Not doing the card?

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:39]** Yeah, was not doing a card or doing a card.

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:40]** And it says normal damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:43]** What am I losing by not doing the card?

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:46]** Or what am I gaining by not doing the card?

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:46]** In this case, double damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:53]** Normally, you would have gotten the bleed effect or the sickening effect, which is actually really good, but it doesn't work on constructs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:57]** So wait, I don't get the vulnerability bonus of...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:57 - 00:55:01]** I'm going to give you the vulnerability, but you just don't get the double damage.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:02]** But I don't get to do double damage?

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:02]** Right.

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:03]** So what was your first roll?

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:05]** A six plus one, seven points of damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:06]** Yeah, so six points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:09]** Forget this stupid.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:10]** Wait, sorry.

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:12]** Seven points of damage plus half of that.

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:13]** What is half of seven?

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:13]** It's going to be three?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:15]** So ten total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:15]** Oh, man.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:18]** This thing is on its last leg.

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:21]** If you didn't take that crit card, it might have actually worked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:31]** I thought I could take that crit card without it being... I didn't know the crit cards had a... I didn't think it was a trade-off, but that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:31]** It's usually not.

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:33]** That's why it's a bit of a gamble.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:41]** Also, if it wasn't a construct, it would be sickened for up to eight rounds, which is like... Yeah, it sickens pretty bad.

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:43]** That's like a really good effect.

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:44]** But, yeah, that's what happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:46]** Now we know.

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:48]** Killer robots, they're the worst.

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:49]** Killer robots.

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:50]** Ralu.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:51]** Murderbots, man.

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:52]** Ralu says...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:56]** I literally just blanked.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:56]** I'm so sorry.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:57]** It's just Sunday.

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:59]** I just totally blanked as a person.

**[00:55:59 - 00:55:59]** I just blanked.

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:01]** I was like, yep, I got this right in the bag.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:03]** And then I totally blanked on what I was going to say.

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:06]** Bro Lewis is like, press on and keep shooting.

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:08]** This thing will be over soon.

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:10]** And he's going to take two shots.

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:14]** First one is a 15 against EAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:15]** You have a different weapon now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:17]** It's always been EAC.

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:18]** It's always been EAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:19]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:22]** Okay, that's a miss.

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:23]** 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:23]** Nothing.

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:25]** Except for me.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:27]** Somebody else, please take it out on my behalf.

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:28]** Thank you.

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:29]** I'll take the credit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:31]** That is the end of round number three.

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:35]** This thing literally has one HP of life left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:36]** Get out of here!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:39]** And it's turn.

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:42]** It is going to do Jolting Arc.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:43]** Regeneration.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:44]** Jolting Arc.

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:45]** I bet Will is mad right now.

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:46]** Wait, how is it going to do Jolting Arc?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:47]** We're too far away, aren't we?

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:49]** Well, give me a second.

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:50]** Give me a second.

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:51]** It's 15 to your memory.

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:53]** It's range 40.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:55]** I thought it was 15.

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:55]** Oh, okay.

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:57]** That's the, that's the, my bad.

**[00:56:57 - 00:56:58]** My bad.

**[00:56:58 - 00:56:58]** Okay.

**[00:56:59 - 00:56:59]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:01]** I meant to move, but I was measuring instead.

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:03]** Uh, so yeah, it's going to step forward.

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:05]** It's now got the three of you in range.

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:06]** So it's got Rolu.

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:07]** What?

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:09]** All right.

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:09]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:10]** I'm 45 feet.

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:11]** I thought you said 40 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:12]** I misspoke, man.

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:12]** Give me a second.

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:15]** It's Rolhu, Chak, and Thaddeus.

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:17]** If you guys both didn't have THs in your names, it wouldn't be so hard.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:22]** So I can hit anybody in 40 range as long as they're within 30 feet of each other.

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:25]** So you're safe again, Treme.

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:28]** The other three of you, I need reflex saves.

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:29]** Against Rolhu?

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:31]** Sorry, Tholu?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:34]** I think three of us should have THs in our names.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:37]** So it should be Tholu, Thaddeus, and Thaddeus.

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:40]** Tholu, Thaddeus, Tremay, and Thak.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:42]** Tremay.

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:43]** Thak.

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:44]** I was thinking Chath.

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:45]** Or Chath.

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:49]** Chath.

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:49]** Chath.

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:50]** That's a 21 for Tholu.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:50]** And Tremath.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:52]** That's going to be six points of damage.

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:53]** Okay.

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:57]** So you go half on that, so that's three points of damage for Tholu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:57 - 00:57:58]** Yep.

**[00:57:58 - 00:58:00]** That's a 10 on the reflex.

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:01]** I'm 12 for Chath.

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:02]** 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:04]** So the two of you take full damage.

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:08]** You guys each take six points of damage as the ground charges.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:10]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:16]** All three of you go, but Rolu is able to, like, he's wearing those thick rubber boots or something.

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:18]** He's able to hop.

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:20]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:20]** Come on.

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:21]** Thaddeus, you're up.

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:22]** What are you going to do?

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:26]** Thaddeus' entire hair is just all, like, staticked out everywhere right now.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:27]** He's pissed off.

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:33]** He looks, like, twice as big, which hopefully will, like, freak Rolu out, but probably not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:34]** He looks like he just got back from the groomer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:36]** He's standing behind.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:38]** He's standing behind Rolu.

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:39]** He's got a bone.

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:39]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:39 - 00:59:02]** he's so angry but like his hair stand up so much that it kind of tickles your back because it's like that big now all right so he's gonna like roll twice to attack and as before rolls an eight amazingly as he does every time and then he rolls in a 22 minus four being 18 which will hit because i know this at this point for seven points of damage

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:03]** Fuck you.

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:05]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:08]** And once again, it's always Thaddeus that gets the final hit.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:12]** He's just like, pew, pew, shoot wildly in that second shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:15]** Sharks got a few hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:18]** In the history books, we'll say that Thaddeus does.

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:21]** That little murder bot we had to kill.

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:22]** No big deal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:23]** That's fine.

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:26]** Just the biggest thing we've fought so far.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:28]** So it is dead.

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:35]** That final shot from Thaddeus hits it right in the middle of its optical device.

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:38]** And it goes... I got shot in the head.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:43]** It's almost like the carapace splits into multiple pieces as this thing crumbles to the ground.

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:49]** And you see the nanobots, the nanites, just kind of flurry away from it like spiders.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:49 - 01:00:08]** the nano murder uh thaddeus like you know like touches his arm and goes like bleep and like because he like touches his communicator and then he's like i took the liberty of recording that for you it's in your inbox and then uh and then yeah he just kind of like starts to like bat down his fur with his tongue


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:19]** My favorite part of this is like, okay, for clarity, did you tap your communicator to like intentionally broadcast this to Terme?

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:23]** Or was that you capturing the recording?

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:26]** Oh, no, it was me capturing the recording.

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:27]** Okay, cool.

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:29]** I like that.

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:30]** You said you tapped your communicator.

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:35]** I was like, okay, he's intentionally putting this on the radio right next to Rolu.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:43]** I just thought that maybe there was recording on these communicators.

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:44]** It's probably not the case.

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:45]** Sure there is.

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:46]** It's a little like arm computer.

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:48]** Yeah.

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:50]** I love that.

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:51]** Is everyone okay?

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:57]** Everyone's fine, but Kevin has a look of like he's going to pull out another one of them, which is going to drop out of the ceiling.

**[01:00:57 - 01:00:58]** He does.

**[01:00:58 - 01:00:58]** Hopefully not.

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:08]** I was like, oh, you killed it, blah, blah, blah.

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:10]** And then you guys started talking and I didn't want to waste it.

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:11]** That is our game.

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:11]** We'll see you next week.
