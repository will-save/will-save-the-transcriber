**[00:00:01 - 00:00:12]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:13]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:15]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:16]** Get out.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:19]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:23]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:23 - 00:00:30]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales of the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:33]** unknown treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:00:55 - 00:00:56]** All right, everybody.

**[00:00:56 - 00:00:58]** Welcome back to Unknown Treasures.

**[00:00:58 - 00:00:59]** I'm Kevin, your GM.

**[00:01:00 - 00:01:02]** I'm fantastic at what I do, and I never mess up.

**[00:01:02 - 00:01:07]** And this is We'll Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:08 - 00:01:30]** in one breath way to go dude yeah dude that was a good nice little clip and uh well done yeah yeah it doesn't help that it's also super hot in the middle of summer yeah probably still not fixed by the time we should just get some whisper quiet fans maybe once we do a patreon that should be one of the tiers


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:32]** I heard whisper quiet fans.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:33 - 00:01:33]** That's what I said.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:33 - 00:01:36]** And I was thinking, like, you know, people who like our shows.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:38]** Are very quiet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:40]** Very quiet.

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:40]** Great job.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:42]** That's also a tear.

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:46]** I love this episode.

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:47]** But, like, 10 dB down.

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:50]** Very quiet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:51]** Listen at low volume.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:53]** Listen at low volume.

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:56]** Never mind that they can just turn it down themselves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:57]** We'll save.

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:59]** Remastered for ASMR.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:01]** The ASMR episodes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:06]** That's too good.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:07]** That needs to happen.

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:09]** I've also just, I've spent all week.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:38]** beating myself up about how bad i messed up that last episode and you guys are like no it's fine don't worry but like uh i had so much i had that episode planned to be so much bigger and then it was already big in our mind there was like the there was the stuff with like torment that yes there was a flashback then there are the bodies and there's this thing that's gonna demolish us and totally do a tpk so i mean are we hiding the fact that we record a


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:41]** It was like last week when I was like, but honestly, okay, listen, people.

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:43]** We recorded four episodes today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:48]** This is our fourth episode that we're recording in one day because we want to be able to get you guys episodes every week.

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:51]** Kevin made us wake up at 8 a.m.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:54]** I actually was in heavy support of the 8 a.m.

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:55]** call time.

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:56]** Thank you, Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:58]** I'm not mad at it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:58 - 00:02:59]** I really liked it.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:02]** This is the perk of being on the East Coast.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:08]** I woke up, I got the groceries, I fixed my wife's car, I poured a drink, and here we're playing games.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:09]** He's brunching it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:11]** I took my son to get his hair cut.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:14]** We did some swinging time in the backyard.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:15]** We get that you live in the future.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:17]** I moved out of my bed.

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:21]** Yeah, I got out of my bed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:29]** And you're right, that week of torture has only been about 14 minutes between the time we stopped recording.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:31]** Still, it feels like a week.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:32]** We had time to reflect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:37]** We have never been able to record more than two episodes, even in person.

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:38]** We've never been able to do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:41]** We did try one time, and we didn't come in very close.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:42]** No.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:44]** So this is already great.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:45]** Congrats to us.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:47]** Cheers.

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:48]** Cheers to us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:49]** Cheers, gentlemen.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:49]** Cheers.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:50]** Cheers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:52]** It's a new, yeah.

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:53]** We have leveled up.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:53]** I think it's fair.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:54]** Our podcast has leveled up.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:57]** Our player characters have not, but we have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:58]** It's also one of those things, too.

**[00:03:58 - 00:04:04]** Like, I love that we do this podcast because it gives me a good excuse to, like, hang out with you guys and play TTRPGs.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:11]** And this has been a really good excuse to play four and a half hours of TTRPGs.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:12]** So, yeah.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:13]** It's like a normal session.

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:16]** I'm the one stuck jamming, so it's been, like, bittersweet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:21]** You guys remember when we would regularly do, like, four, six, eight-hour sessions?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:21]** Right?

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:23]** Like, I think three hours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:28]** And then we'd go to sleep, wake up again, and play more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:36]** Yeah, I definitely remember with Brendan, shout out to How the Quest Was Won.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:37]** That was classic.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:42]** It was like, go over to his house on a Saturday, have homework to do, but ignore it.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:44]** Of course.

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:44]** Of course.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:46]** Naturally.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:54]** Start at like six, order some pizzas, play until like six, fall asleep for two hours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:57]** Before we move on from food, we need to shout out Brendan's mom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:58 - 00:04:59]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:04]** She would take chocolate chip cookies, put ice cream in the middle.

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:05]** Oh, what?

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:08]** And, like, those were her homemade ice cream.

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:09]** Those things were dope.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:10]** Like a homemade Diddy Reese.

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:13]** Absolutely dope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:16]** And then they'd go to bed, and she'd be like, they're in the freezer whenever you want them.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:19]** And we'd be like, oh, we could go while.

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:24]** And then in the morning, she or his dad would wake up.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:25]** Shout out to y'all.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:26]** While we were all sleeping.

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:27]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:27]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:29]** they would go get us donuts.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:32]** Knowing that we would wake up and keep playing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:33]** This is amazing.

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:35]** What a great childhood.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:36]** Shout out, Brent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:38]** I'm super jealous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:40]** I did none of this.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:41]** I'm curious.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:45]** What's the longest span that you guys have played TTRPGs?

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:52]** I didn't start playing D&D until I was in my mid-20s, late 20s.

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:57]** Then we started getting an almost weekly game going of Pathfinder

**[00:05:57 - 00:06:00]** And I would drive out there, I think, early in the morning, 8, 9.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:03]** It was like an hour and a half drive to get to my friend's house.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:06]** We would play for like four or five hours, I think.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:10]** But half of that time was spent cleaning up or picking up or setting up.

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:12]** And then cleaning up was like probably an hour.

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:16]** And then we'd stop in the middle and eat.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:17]** So probably only about three hours total.

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:19]** It's probably my longest span of playing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:33]** I think perhaps the longest time besides today was when we played All Knives or All Eyes or All Minds over Phandalin or whatever it was called in person.

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:35]** We did a few long sessions.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:37]** One time we did a very long session.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:38]** We did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:41]** How long was that though?

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:42]** I can't remember.

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:43]** That was like six hours.

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:44]** Maybe?

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:44]** Okay.

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:48]** But again, we stopped in the middle and walked to Taco Bell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:49]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:51]** I remember that part.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:52]** That's part of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:54]** You take breaks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:54 - 00:07:00]** Yeah, like even us staying up all night was not like, I mean, it was pretty continuous, but we would take a break.

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:07]** Then especially if you level up, there's at least an hour break because at that time there was no D&D Beyond.

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:10]** There was, all right, I'm going to grab the player's handbook.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:11]** One person is going to read it.

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:14]** The other person is going to look at this one.

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:19]** And then at some point we have to go into Brandon's computer, update our character sheets or write it out.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:21]** Then you have to print it out.

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:24]** It's like it was a total thing.

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:29]** And then you're reading the third-party books for your class while you're waiting to look at the level-up stats.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:33]** Yeah, that was a really hard time to level.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:37]** Because if you didn't do it right, there were no training wheels.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:38]** You just had a jacked-up character sheet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:40]** You didn't get a warning saying you did it wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:40]** Right.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:47]** To our listeners out there, please go on Discord or Twitter.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:55]** However you guys want to reach out to us, tell us about your longest, your average, your best sessions.

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:57]** Or your fondest.

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:59]** This is a lifestyle.

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:01]** It really is a lifestyle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:02]** It's fun.

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:05]** And this is just for us.

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:06]** We can cut this.

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:17]** If at any point we have a We'll Save where a lot of us are in Jacksonville, especially if it's over a holiday, then we can just reach out to Brendan and go hang at his house and play.

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:21]** I mean, literally each time I go back... Is his mom going to bring us donuts and cook?

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:22]** Dude...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:23]** Yes.

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:23]** I bet she would.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:24]** She actually would.

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:25]** Yeah.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:25]** She, yes.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:26]** Even now.

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:28]** So we still play even now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:28]** Yeah.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:31]** I mean, we were all in the 904 last Christmas, was it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:35]** I wasn't, but you guys played.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:35]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:36]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:38]** I'm down to go to Jacksonville.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:39]** Yeah, why not?

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:41]** I like the airport there.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:42]** They have a good Quiznos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:44]** I've flown in there once, twice.

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:45]** They do have a good Quiznos.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:47]** Three times.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:48]** I'll figure it out.

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:50]** Let's pull up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:57]** I don't know if I've ever told you guys, I used to go to Jacksonville because that's where one of the manufacturers were for the freezers that I used to install.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:58 - 00:08:58]** Oh, really?

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:00]** Where in Jacksonville?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:00]** I don't know.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:06]** I'd get off the plane, get in my rental car, and then drive to wherever Google Maps told me to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:11]** I've been to Jacksonville one time to go to Georgia.

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:13]** Makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:16]** Yeah.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:16]** It's a fun place.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:17]** It's a lot to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:20]** Oh, Jacksonville.


## Speaker_0

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:20]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:24]** All right, so I do have a little thing planned.

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:28]** We're not done yet with Two Truths and a Lie.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:29]** Oh.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:31]** So please raise your hand if you haven't gone.

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:35]** Everyone what?


## Speaker_0

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:35]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:38]** Uh, wait, what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:48]** So this documentary series that was taking place on the Caduceus, that's actually, they do, like, individual episodes of different genres, and they chose that ship for whatever reason.

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:49]** We're going to move back.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:58]** They actually chose to visit Akiton and went down to a little town called Kavok Depot, and they chose to interview local business owners within that town.

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:05]** They set up in this quote-unquote lobby of this weird... So they...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:07]** They went through the no-fly zone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:11]** No, they probably landed in the middle and took a train, a bus.

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:19]** But they set up in this little lobby, and there's just a couch there in a large office area with a bunch of junk in the corner.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:26]** And this Yosuke woman walks over, sits down on the couch, and there's a little junk table put together.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:29]** It kind of looks like a clutch and a camshaft.

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:37]** welded together with a flywheel from a different vehicle on it, just like the one that I have in a real one in my storage area.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:40]** There's actually like three bowls there.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:46]** And the shisoki sits down on the couch and the director is going to ask them to give two truths and a lie.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:50]** So whenever you're ready, you know, just go ahead.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:53]** So you want two truths and one lie.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:54]** All right.

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:57]** I guess I'll tell you.

**[00:10:57 - 00:11:00]** One is that I'm a junk sculptor.

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:02]** You know, I like to put together junk and make it all pretty.

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:05]** And another one...

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:11]** I inherited Junker's Delight from my grandfather.

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:14]** And then my last one would be that I have a cousin.

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:23]** His name is Cecil, and he lives over in Morrow, but he just graduated from the Abadokor Security Academy.

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:24]** All right, so that's three.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:26]** What do I do now?

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:27]** No, that's good.

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:35]** Please just give a second for our listeners to kind of give their opinions to each other and talk out loud, and then we'll come back and get your answers.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:35]** Okay.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:36]** All right.

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:36]** Cutting away from that.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:38]** Guys, this is Riddle.

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:39]** Surprise.

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:40]** It's Riddle talking.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:41]** Yeah.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:41]** So go ahead.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:41]** Tell me.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:45]** I want to hear each of you guys what you guys think was the truth and what was the lie.

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:45]** Wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:50]** So there's junk sculptor inherited it from her uncle.

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:51]** Grandfather.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:51]** Grandfather.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:53]** Grandfather.

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:53]** Grandfather.

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:54]** Father.

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:54]** Grandfather.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:55]** Grandfather.

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:55]** Uncle.

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:56]** I said I said grandfather.

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:58]** If I said that funny, I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:58 - 00:12:01]** And then third one was somebody graduated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:06]** Her cousin in Mara graduated from Avidar Security Corps.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:08]** Correct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:08]** Okay.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:11]** Avidar Corps Security Academy.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:12]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:13]** Cecil, right?

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:14]** Cecil.

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:16]** Did you say the cousin's name?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:17]** Cecil.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:19]** Cecil.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:20]** Cecil.

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:21]** Yeah, it's Italian.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:22]** The gabagool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:33]** It's just my impression, but I feel like Riddle, with the amount of pride that they take in their... I feel like they didn't inherit it, and then they built this business on their own.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:36]** It's just a guess based on... Yeah, that's true.

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:39]** Too snippy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:41]** Interesting, Kelly.

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:43]** All right, that's your vote.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:44]** Vinny?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:50]** I think the junk sculptor is the lie.

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:54]** I think she likes junk, but she doesn't necessarily make art out of it.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:54]** Okay.

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:55]** John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:55 - 00:13:00]** Yeah, I'm going with the junk sculptor, but less because she doesn't make art out of it, but more...

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:03]** Cause I think she just doesn't have any time.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:04]** She's like running the business.

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:06]** She's like too busy to do that.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:15]** The, the inherited thing seems like maybe, uh, the cousin thing seems like maybe that's like, that's an accolade, right?

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:18]** That's like a, Oh, like I, I'm proud of my family for doing this.

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:23]** So like, that's probably, I like, like she doesn't seem like the type to make that up.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:24]** I feel like it's the art thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:25]** So all three years?

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:27]** No, sorry.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:29]** Kelly is saying the inherited.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:32]** Vinny and John are both saying the art sculptures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:42]** Yeah, I was going to lean towards art sculptor, and now I'm thinking that the cousin thing, maybe she's exaggerating a bit.

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:45]** So I'm going to go with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:47]** All right.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:54]** And please, listeners, if you're listening in, which you are, clearly, if you're hearing me say that, go ahead, hop on Twitter, Discord, wherever.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:54]** Tell us what you think.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:57]** And then we're going to cut back to that scene.

**[00:13:57 - 00:14:00]** And the director of this documentary is going to be like, all right, thank you, Riddle.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:01]** That's been enough time.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:06]** We're going to... If you could just tell us now which one was the truth, which was a lie.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:10]** And if you want to, not exaggerate, explain a little bit more about each of those things, that'd be great.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:13]** Whenever you're ready, go ahead.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:13]** Yeah, all right.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:14]** I can do that.

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:16]** So...

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:18]** I guess I'll start with the truth.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:20]** You guys can kind of see like around my stuff here.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:23]** I made that one there and I made that one there.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:27]** That one is called As the Sun Sets on Akitan.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:29]** I am definitely an art sculptor.

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:34]** I put junk together and I think I like it, but a lot of people don't really.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:35]** It's all right.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:35]** It's fun.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:37]** But I sell that stuff too if anybody's interested.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:38]** You guys interested?

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:39]** You want to buy something?


## Speaker_0

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:39]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:44]** The other truth is actually my cousin actually did.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:45]** He's graduating.

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:47]** My cousin Cecil, I'm really proud of him.

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:49]** I think he's kind of like, he's like the golden child of our family.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:53]** You know, like I got a lot of cousins, but he's the only one that's ever made something of himself.

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:56]** And he made it into Abbott Accord Security Academy.

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:57]** He graduated recently.

**[00:14:57 - 00:15:02]** And I just hope one day he's going to get like that big shot police officer position, you know.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:06]** And I hope it kind of opens the precinct down here because things are getting kind of ugly down here at Cathoctipo.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:08]** It's not real pretty.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:12]** So maybe he can get Abadok Kor to put a little squeeze, you know?

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:16]** The lie was definitely that I inherited this from my grandfather.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:19]** I love my grandfather, but no, he was stuck out in the mines.

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:22]** The Thessalonians mines are real dirty, real gross.

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:23]** He didn't...

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:24]** I feel so bad.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:26]** I can't imagine having to do that.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:33]** But no, I actually opened up this shop myself and I was selling my junk sculptor, trying to make it like a nice little boutique.

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:35]** But then I got into like the guide business.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:36]** That's fairly new.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:44]** You know, people come around town, they're looking for junk, but they also want to think like they can go out and get their own treasures.

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:52]** And so, yeah, I started hiring some local muscle to kind of like guide these guys and girls around.

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:57]** into the junkyards and the car yards and the outer ring to, you know, try to find their own treasures.

**[00:15:58 - 00:16:01]** And that's why they start kind of looking at my own sculptors and stuff.

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:03]** But yeah, that's about it.

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:04]** Is that good?

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:05]** Is that what you guys are looking for?

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:06]** No, no, that's great.

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:07]** Thanks.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:07]** I appreciate that.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:09]** You know, we can wrap up here.

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:11]** Thank you for showing us around.

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:13]** You know, we really appreciate it.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:14]** And that's going to cut it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:15]** That was great.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:16]** That was awesome.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:17]** That was so good.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:18]** Oh.

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:18]** Yeah.

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:23]** Maybe Rolu as a fellow artist might be interested in that sculpture.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:25]** That's one of the sculptures, perhaps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:25]** Yeah.

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:30]** Next time you guys are at Junkers Delight, though, Thaddeus is going to kick one of them over.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:33]** What is this junk?

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:34]** What is this junk?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:36]** If we make it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:36]** Yeah.

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:37]** If we make it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:40]** If we make it back, then Rolo will purchase one.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:40]** We'll see.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:41]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:42]** So let's go back to the map.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:45]** Sorry, I'm a terrible GM.

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:52]** I should have just left it at like, this giant Thessarac or Thestarian K'fok jumps out at you and you guys are like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:52]** You did.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:53]** That's how we cut it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:55]** Oh, okay, cool.

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:56]** Editing, making that work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:58]** Yeah, dude, I'm scared.

**[00:16:58 - 00:17:00]** I am slowly wetting myself.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:01]** Can I play the battle music?

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:03]** Is that what we're doing now?

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:04]** I think you should play the battle music.

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:04]** Oh, goodness.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:05]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:11]** That's battle music.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:13]** Yes.

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:13]** Cool.

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:14]** Well, let's get started.

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:17]** Flashback of what happened last time.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:24]** You guys had just escaped from the K'Fox, left you real dirty with adding a million K'Fox coming at you out of that nest.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:26]** You guys got into a comfort zone.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:27]** You rested up just a little bit.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:29]** You had a little back and forth.

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:32]** There were messages that were supposed to come in that didn't make it all the way through.

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:35]** And then Choc tried to send a message out and

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:57]** that also didn't make it out you guys then cut through this tight channel of of where the junk had fallen and uh Treme and Rolu took some damage from that which caused you guys to rest up again on the other side of that and then you guys came into this open field of sand where you found an escape pod from the stellar flare an iPod

**[00:17:57 - 00:17:59]** An iPod, an iEscape pod.

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:02]** And then you also found two bodies in the sand.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:09]** And what you know from those two bodies is one is very likely Lorgan, the last and loyal guide of Riddle.

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:11]** And the other one is definitely a true warrior.

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:15]** But the weird thing about it is these guys weren't shooting at each other.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:19]** they were shooting in the same direction, and their bodies had been eaten.

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:24]** And I know, Will, you asked me if there was any loot on these bodies, and I'm going to tell you no.

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:28]** Whatever loot would have been on their bodies was eaten alive.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:37]** Or I guess a gun wouldn't be alive, but anything useful was chewed to pieces, probably by this giant kafak that you're about to face.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:42]** By giant, I mean it's a medium-sized creature, but still pretty big.

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:43]** Yeah, pretty big.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:45]** And I think that's everything.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:51]** Last but not least, there is a hover truck in the far distant part of this map.

**[00:18:51 - 00:19:02]** And there was also a brief story where one android with long green braids was running from something and there were gunshots in the background.

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:09]** They ended up in a truck, and when they closed their eyes and opened their eyes again, they were actually on a ship of some sort and running down a hallway.

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:12]** Anybody else remember anything specific from that?

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:12]** The lights were going out.

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:13]** Lights were going out.

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:14]** Anything else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:15]** Smoke, I think.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:16]** Some escape pod thing, right?

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:18]** Yeah, they're trying to get you an escape pod.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:23]** I think something else that I was hoping you guys would pick up on is that Vari-X, we'll say.

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:24]** Yes.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:26]** Vari-N, whatever...

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:41]** acronym letter you want to put in place of a number so i don't tell you the specific number um they made it to the command center the the bridge and they pulled something out from underneath the command the captain's step chair yes

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:45]** And they also linked up their... Communicator and synced some codes.

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:46]** Communicator, transponder codes.

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:48]** Let's make sure we got that in the notes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:49]** Oh, get that in the notes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:50]** Cool.

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:52]** And so now we're going to flashback to where we are.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:55]** Termay, you were standing between those two bodies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:59]** But I was successfully... And you were looking at them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:59 - 00:19:59]** Negated.

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:06]** Well, I perceived something was wrong via my wristwatch, whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:07]** Right.

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:10]** There was a Geiger that was clicking at you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:13]** And I passed my reflex save as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:20]** You passed a 42 save and a reflex save, so I let you move away from where this Kefauk was when it blew out of the ground.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:22]** I'll be a little bit honest.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:30]** I had this plan to make it like a game where you guys would move kind of up and around, and I'd be rolling dice to try to see if you guys got close.

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:35]** That failed because all of my rolls made this Kefauk move further and further away, and I was like, I quit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:37]** No, you should have kept it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:38]** Yeah, that was good.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:38]** I know.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:39]** That would have been great for you guys.

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:40]** The K'vok is gone.

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:45]** So I was picturing definitely something more out of... Did we roll for initiative?

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:45]** Tremors.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:46]** Tremors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:48]** Yeah, Kevin Bacon, man.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:48]** I love Tremors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:49]** It's classic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:50]** Never seen it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:52]** What?

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:52]** You need to.

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:54]** You should let your kids watch it.

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:54]** It's great.

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:58]** I saw it when I was like five, and I remember this very distinctly.

**[00:20:58 - 00:21:01]** I was standing behind my couch...

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:24]** watching it and every time the trimmers would come up i would like duck down behind the couch and scream oh my god i was a five-year-old watching a rated r uh horror film anyways is it rated that's what i was trying to you know to to pass on to you guys with this it didn't quite work out but now there's this giant gross worm does anyone describe it go ahead describe this thing to me well we described it last time it was do it again give me


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:27]** Is that like centipede lobster creature?

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:37]** It looks like it's like coiled like a cobra, but has all the centipede legs on it and has these lobster claws and in a sword on its butt.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:44]** And a sword on its butt and it's purple and has this beautiful hues of green and purple and fuchsia.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:48]** Yeah, so I like to imagine that the carapace is like a purple shell.

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:49]** Yeah.

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:54]** And that everything else you see is actually like a green glow from underneath.

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:56]** Like its internals are glowing green.

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:59]** Because this thing is radioactive.

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:00]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:01]** You're just telling us that now?

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:02]** Holy cow.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:02]** Dang.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:04]** Yeah, well, that's what the Geiger countermeasures radiation.

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:05]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:05]** That's right.

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:05]** That's right.

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:06]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:07]** Also, Tremors is rated PG-13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:09]** PG-13.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:10]** All right.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:10]** I was five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:11]** Yeah.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:13]** I'm not saying it wasn't scary, man.

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:16]** I'm just telling you it's not rated R if you want to go watch it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:17]** Totally go watch it.

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:18]** Cool.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:19]** So, yes, now is the time.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:23]** Can you please roll for audition?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:25]** Here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:28]** 16.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:34]** 16 for Thaddeus.

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:36]** 3 for Chuck.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:38]** 3 for Chuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:40]** Treme got a 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:41]** Oh, man.

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:43]** Rolugata, 7.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:44]** Seven.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:45]** Horrible.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:46]** And I love it.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:48]** I love, like, DICE always tell the story so well.

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:55]** I feel like Thaddeus is kind of, like, standing at the edge of this, you know, the furthest back, and he's just watching everything.

**[00:22:55 - 00:23:00]** Meanwhile, Rolu and Chuck are focused on the escape pod.

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:00]** So they're turned away.

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:01]** Yep.

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:03]** Which means their initiatives are going to be lower.

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:04]** Yep.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:05]** Where Termay was right in it.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:07]** And he's like, whoa!

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:08]** And he does his good reflex save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:09]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:12]** And he's got a high initiative.

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:12]** Oh, man.

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:13]** All right.

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:16]** Treme, it is actually your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:17]** All right.

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:31]** Treme, seeing this creature and its underfoot coming up, he's going to be super alarmed, and he is going to be like, we need to take this thing out quickly.

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:34]** And he's going to cast Overheat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:36]** Got him.

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:36]** Got him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:38]** And then run off.

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:39]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:43]** Is overheat a standard action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:48]** Overheat's a spell... Standard action.

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:49]** One standard action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:50]** Nice.

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:54]** I just want to make sure you can run off after you overheat.

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:55]** Okay, so overheat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:56]** Yes.

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:57]** 15-foot cone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:58 - 00:23:58]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:00]** Nice.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:04]** DC 14 for my caster, I guess.

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:05]** I have to hit, right?

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:08]** I think I... Do you roll a to hit on that?

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:10]** I don't understand how magic works.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:13]** Nobody knows.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:15]** I think I have to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:19]** I think I have to... I think you do roll a hit, and then I get a DC save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:20]** I don't think there's a save.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:23]** Reflex for half.

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:25]** DC 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:26]** Oh, so I don't have to roll.

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:28]** There's no roll to hit.

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:29]** It's just a reflex save.

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:30]** It's just a reflex save.

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:31]** So I just roll 2d8.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:38]** Well, yeah, you can roll 2d8, and then I'll roll whether or not I take half.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:42]** It should say in Hero Lab what the DC for the reflex save is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:43]** And you don't have to tell me.

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:44]** You can just tell me whether or not I pass.

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:46]** 14 points.

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:47]** Reflexes.

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:49]** Anus.

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:49]** I hope he fails.

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:53]** I got a 24 reflexes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:53]** I think he failed.

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:55]** So seven points to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:57]** So I take seven points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:58]** Dang.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:58 - 00:25:00]** Wait, you got 16 and half of that is seven?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:02]** No, 14 and half is seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:03]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:05]** Does he still take fire damage or is that only?

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:06]** Yeah, it's fire damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:07]** Yeah, does it all go through?

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:09]** It's all fire damage, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:09]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:09]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:10]** Okay.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:11]** And it seems like it all goes through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:14]** The DC was 14, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:16]** And you got a 24 on your reflex?

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:22]** So it's halved, but I think John is asking if it seems like he's resistant to fire.

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:27]** Or did he put on any of that fire-resistant sunblock that the Helki had earlier?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:28]** Yeah.

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:29]** Did he put on some sunscreen?

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:31]** SPF 50?

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:33]** Why is that not working?

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:34]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:35]** I just have to do it by hand.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:37]** All right, moving on, Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:38]** Oh, and I move away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:39]** And you move away.

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:42]** Okay, go ahead and take your move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:49]** I'm going to get behind the whips over here with some soft cover, perhaps.

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:50]** Partial cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:57]** Actually, before you do that, and I'm so sorry, but I'm trying to figure this out myself.

**[00:25:57 - 00:26:01]** I believe you have to do another fortitude.

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:01]** For what?

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:03]** Because you started your turn.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:05]** You started your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:07]** In a certain range of him or something?

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:08]** Is that why?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:09]** That's what I'm saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:10]** 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:11]** You pass.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:12]** Okay, you pass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:15]** Yeah, I think he probably started in the radiation.

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:17]** Yeah, okay, okay.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:18]** That's what I'm thinking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:20]** Okay, so that is the end of your turn?

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:21]** Yeah.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:22]** Thaddeus?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:31]** Thaddeus is first going to do a life science to see if he can detect any special abilities of this, and he does not pass.

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:34]** So what he's going to do... Well, what did you roll?

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:38]** It was like a four, so... It was a four, okay.

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:39]** Well, does he notice anything with a four, Kevin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:44]** I think just as an observational skill, you realize that this thing is a kafak.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:47]** But it's also not a kafak.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:49]** Super helpful.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:55]** I feel like from your previous knowledge of K'foks from the nest and everything else, you know what a normal K'fok looks like.

**[00:26:56 - 00:27:01]** And you're like, guys, this thing looks like a mutated version of a K'fok.

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:02]** That's what I'll tell you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:03]** God, this is horrible.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:05]** You can sense the name.

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:06]** It's like a mutated version of a K'fok.

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:07]** There you go.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:09]** So now he's going to do a ranged attack.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:11]** It's 18.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:11]** Does that hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:13]** 18 does hit.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:14]** Thankfully.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:16]** Is that KAC or EAC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:16]** EAC.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:19]** I think it's like a projectile, so KAC, I believe, right?

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:28]** And then he's going to roll for damage, and that's...

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:48]** four points of damage plus two points of poison damage so i guess like six in total and this is strength poison so you'll be on the strength poison track if this yeah okay wait wait that's it slow down yeah my bad six points of damage six points of damage

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:48]** Oh, no, no, no.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:50]** I'm so sorry, Kevin.

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:52]** I see now why I did the D20 thing.

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:53]** So that's six points of damage.

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:53]** No, no, no.

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:56]** Two points of damage, and then you're poisoned on the strength track.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:57]** Okay.

**[00:27:57 - 00:28:01]** Two points of damage, and then I'm on the poison strength track.

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:14]** But I do... So for poisons, somewhere in the book, poisons, I get a DC minus 10 of damage, and I also get a DC to save, right?

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:15]** Okay, so I get a saving throw.

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:17]** Do you have a DC associated with that?

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:19]** I believe it's like a fortitude save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:23]** Yeah, there's usually a... It's the DC of the poison, right?

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:25]** This could be big if it goes through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:26]** Actually, it's actually dex.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:31]** So, and fortitude DC 14, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:32]** Okay, so it's a DC 14.

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:45]** So I have to roll a fortitude save that beats DC 14, but it does say that upon initial exposure, regardless of whether she succeeds at her saving throw, the victim loses a number of hit points equal to the DC minus 10.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:47]** So I will take four more points off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:48]** Good stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:49]** Four more points.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:53]** But then I also get to roll a fortitude.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:56]** Oh, and I am in fact poisoned.

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:57]** Yes.

**[00:28:58 - 00:28:58]** You said dexterity?

**[00:28:58 - 00:29:00]** Dexterity, so you are sluggish.

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:02]** I am now sluggish.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:02]** Yes.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:06]** Oh, I hate when you do this because now I got to figure out what sluggish means.

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:06]** I have it right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:12]** Victim takes a minus two penalty to reflect saves and dexterity based ability checks, attack rolls and skill checks.

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:14]** Nice.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:20]** DCs of her spells and special abilities decreased by two and she becomes flat footed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:27]** Sorry, so key points there is flat-footed, so I get a minus what to my AC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:28]** I don't have flat-footed pulled up.

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:29]** I have boys pulled up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:30]** It's minus two to AC, right?

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:31]** No, no, no.

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:33]** I don't think there's any minus to AC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:35]** No, I think flat-footed is just you can't take AOOs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:39]** Oh, no, flat-footed is minus two to AC.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:40]** You're right.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:40]** Okay.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:43]** And can't take reactions, so minus two to AC.

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:44]** Minus two to AC, can't take reactions.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:47]** Yeah, minus two to your attack rolls.

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:48]** Minus two to my attack rolls, okay.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:54]** Also, minus two to your DCs for your effects or special abilities.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:55]** Okay.

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:58]** I'll paste it in Unknown Treasures, too.

**[00:29:58 - 00:29:58]** Oh, thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:58 - 00:30:03]** That's a lot of things going on real fast.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:04]** Do you make a move action at all?

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:06]** Because that's just your shot, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:12]** He is going to, because this thing might try to track him, I'm guessing, potentially.

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:19]** He's going to move out of the general arena and into the canyon a little bit.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:20]** Yeah, for now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:20]** He's smart.

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:21]** He already went down twice.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:24]** He's not going to get in combat with these.


## Speaker_0

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:29]** Just for the listener, so there is a wide open field and the Kefak is kind of dead in the middle of it.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:35]** Rolu and Chak are down in the south portion of it near the escape pod from the Stellar Flare.

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:41]** Terme is right at the opening to this large sand area.

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:44]** near the entryway where they came from on the southeast side.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:50]** And Thaddeus had just now just stepped back behind Treme, you know, back into that mouth.

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:55]** It is now Thastoran Kefak's turn.

**[00:30:55 - 00:31:04]** And it is going to... I'm going to say it's going to move down towards where Thaddeus was.

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:07]** So it watched Thaddeus run away.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:08]** Run away!

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:09]** And it's going to...

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:12]** See, Torme is also down there.

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:18]** And so... Tactical retreat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:21]** I believe that is within 30 feet, correct?

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:22]** Oh, my God.

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:28]** It moved immediately in front of... So it has a 30-foot range, it appears.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:29]** Shoot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:30]** Man, I'm so bad at this.

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:31]** I'm just trying to think out what I'm doing.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:38]** No, it has 48 feet of movement speed, and it can burrow up to 42 feet.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:39]** Oh, goodness.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:40]** Okay.

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:46]** All right, so it's going to move that far, and now it is going to use its claw to attack Treme.

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:47]** Oh, God.

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:50]** So I get a minus two to attacks because I'm sluggish?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:51]** Yes.


## Speaker_0

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:51]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:52 - 00:32:13]** 10 on the dice miss nice wait wait wait wait wait oh my gosh actually math it sucks uh that's a 19 to hit that hits does there any minuses on the damage no no minuses to damage um okay make sure i got this right because it seems pretty high uh yep nope that's right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:15]** Oh, God.

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:16]** Going down, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:17]** That is seven points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:19]** I'm down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:20]** Oh, my God.

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:22]** Dude, how are we supposed to do this at level one?

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:22]** I'm down.

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:23]** Are you down?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:27]** Yeah, that's all my stamina plus two of my hit points that I had left, so I'm down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:29]** Just put this little skull next to you.

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:30]** All right.

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:32]** Rolu.

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:33]** It's Rolu's turn?

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:34]** It's now your turn.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:37]** But to start your turn, I need you to roll me a Fortitude save.

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:37]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:39]** I got a six.

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:41]** So what do I take?

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:42]** 50 points of damage?

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:46]** I'll just pass so I wouldn't have to get into this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:47]** Yeah, too bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:53]** If you're going to have a creature that takes a sound immediately, you're going to have to do a lot of reading.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:54]** I know, right?

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:56]** So it is poison.

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:57]** Sorry, it's radiation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:58]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:58 - 00:33:00]** And so you have a fortitude save.

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:00]** You failed that.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:02]** You are now on the constitution track.

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:05]** Frequency is one per round.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:07]** Not exactly sure what that means.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:09]** Once per round, you have to roll a fortitude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:10]** Yep.

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:12]** Sorry, and then... It's radiation, right?

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:14]** Radiation constitution track.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:14]** Is that what I said?

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:15]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:17]** Yeah, so I'm going to take damage.

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:18]** It's a poison, so I'm going to take damage.

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:20]** Ten minus the DC.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:21]** The DC minus ten.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:23]** with just three points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:24]** So I take three points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:25]** Oh, my God.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:26]** That's terrible.

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:27]** Yeah.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:33]** The victim then takes... Oh, you are now weakened, which says the victim takes a minus two penalty to fortitude saves.

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:34]** Great.

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:35]** Constitution checks.

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:37]** Constitution-based DCs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:38]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:47]** Every time the victim attempts a fortitude save against the poison, whether he or she succeeds or fails, he loses points as per on initial exposure.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:48]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:48]** Exactly.

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:49]** So I am weakened.

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:50]** Okay.

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:52]** Sounds great.


## Speaker_0

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:53]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:54]** Wait, where is weakened?

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:56]** Oh, that's just the stage.

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:58]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:58 - 00:34:00]** It's the first step on the radiation track.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:04]** I don't know where it's at in Hero Lab.

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:04]** I don't have that open.

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:05]** Afflictions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:06]** It might be under afflictions.

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:07]** I'll figure it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:10]** So instead of level two, what I should be doing is making a new character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:14]** You should.

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:16]** Yeah, I think that's what needs to happen right now.

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:20]** There is a radiation here, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:27]** The crazy thing with radiation, though, is that it's not curable unless you have remove radioactivity.

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:30]** Because remove affliction does not work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:32]** There are two types of radiation.

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:39]** If you're within radiation, and once you are out of an area of radiation, you are no longer affected.

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:43]** Then there's the radiation disease, which is what... Radiation sickness, yeah.

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:47]** Sorry, sickness, which we established that you might have any back in the other show.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:48]** Yeah.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:49]** So that's different.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:57]** So if I leave the area, then I will no longer be affected because that's how it was in â€“ Yeah, because you'll also start moving down the physical track of poison.

**[00:34:57 - 00:35:01]** Right, for the sickness because I'd be down with the sickness.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:02]** Oh, wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:03]** Cool.

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:05]** Well, let's hope it doesn't get to that point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:08]** Roller, what are you going to do?

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:13]** Hopefully I'm right in how this works, but yeah, I think I'm weakened now.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:21]** I think I need to move out of here, and I'm going to try and flank this baddie.

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:24]** I'm going to take a step, move to over here.

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:26]** You're saying a bunch of things that I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:28]** Can you flank from a distance?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:28]** Yes.

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:30]** I think as long as you draw a line.

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:31]** I checked.

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:33]** There's no distance limit.

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:34]** Is that true?

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:35]** Yeah.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:36]** I checked.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:36]** Pretty sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:38]** If so, congrats on you.

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:40]** I'm really impressed by that, but I don't know if I believe you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:41]** I mean, it makes sense.

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:42]** I'm looking up.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:42]** Keep moving.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:43]** Tell me what you're doing.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:48]** It's threatened by another creature on its opposite border or corner.

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:48]** What page is this?

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:49]** 254.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:49]** 254.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:54]** When in doubt, trace a line between the two attackers' centers.

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:55]** Ranged flanking.

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:59]** If the line passes through opposite borders or corners, then the opponent is flanked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:01]** Okay, but is it only for melees?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:02]** Is there a ranged?

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:04]** No, it just says flanking.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:07]** Oh, that does say when making a melee attack.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:08]** That would suck.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:08]** Yes, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:15]** That's why I was really worried for you because you're like, oh, I'm going to flank this thing and then you're going to move closer to it knowing that it has radiation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:17]** Yeah, maybe there's no ranged flanking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:18]** I don't think there is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:19]** Yeah, I don't think there is either.

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:22]** I'm looking on the forums on Paizo.com.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:23]** Yeah, I think you're right.

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:25]** Okay, well, we still need to spread out.

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:28]** We need to find a way to keep all of us alive.

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:31]** How many resolve points do you have, Torme?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:33]** Three.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:34]** Three, okay.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:39]** Or no, actually, I think I forgot to spend one, so I have probably two.

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:40]** Two, great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:45]** I'm going to cast stabilize, and then I'm going to move out of range with this.

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:50]** So I'm going to cast stabilize on you, so you're stable, so you don't have to spend one to stabilize.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:51]** What's the range on that you said?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:53]** 25 feet, I think it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:54]** Okay.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:55]** So you're going to cast it and then move?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:57]** Yeah, I think that's the only thing I can do.

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:59]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:00]** And then what can I do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:05]** Then, next turn, you could spend one to come up to one hit point.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:05]** Ah.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:06]** Yeah.

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:11]** Or if Jack can make it over to you, or somebody can kill you, because I don't have any first-level spells, so I can't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:13]** Wild question.

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:18]** Does being stabilized, do you still take radiation effects?

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:19]** I think you're... Really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:20]** He would still take the radiation damage.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:21]** But you're unconscious.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:22]** From being close to the Kefauk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:27]** I'll roll fortitude.

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:28]** Right?

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:29]** I think you would automatically fail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:33]** No, you get minus some things for what you do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:39]** The question then is that all that damage would do if you failed, it would move you back to die.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:39]** Yeah.

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:43]** And you would have to roll it on your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:43]** Right.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:44]** Okay.

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:52]** So if somehow, by some miracle, this creature dies before my next turn, which based on Kev's face is abundantly unlikely.

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:53]** Not going to ever happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:55]** I'm sorry.

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:57]** I'm trying to figure out where this is going to go.

**[00:37:57 - 00:37:58]** That's fine.

**[00:37:58 - 00:37:59]** What's your hit points right now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:01]** My hit points total?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:03]** Yeah, what's your max?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:03]** Nine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:04]** Okay.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:11]** So the good thing is that even if you're dying, well, no, the bad thing is that I need to stabilize you.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:17]** Because if I don't and you fail, you will lose a resolve point from taking damage if you stay within its radius.

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:18]** Yes.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:23]** So I need to stabilize you and then we need to pull you out of that cone.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:32]** So we need to somehow either Thaddeus needs to back up and pull it away from you or Chak and I need to move and get it to move towards us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:38]** But you're saying there's no way for me to escape the radiation even if I pass a fortitude save?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:49]** No, if you pass the fortitude save and you're stable, then you could conceivably bring yourself to one hit point, but you can't get away unless you can move, which won't happen.

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:54]** Or it moves away, so we need to pull its focus so you can get out.

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:55]** You need to draw it away.

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:56]** Yeah.

**[00:38:56 - 00:39:08]** So I think Rolu's going to shout out exactly that, saying, you know, we need to pull Torme out of this creature's radiation.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:12]** And he's going to step away, I think, 25 feet.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:19]** If you go down again, I'm going to move here, which hopefully moves me out of its range.

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:20]** And...

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:23]** I cast Stabilize on you, so you're stable.

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:23]** Torme.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:24]** Great.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:29]** And I think that is all that I can do right now.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:31]** That's it, unfortunately.

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:34]** Move out of range, try and pull its focus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:36]** I think that's a very good move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:36]** That's it.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:36]** Nice.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:39]** This is very, like... Kev, you're muted.

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:39]** We can't hear you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:42]** I'm GMing this, and I'm, like, sad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:44]** Okay, great.

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:47]** I mean, if we go down, we go down.

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:47]** TPK.

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:47]** Figured out.

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:48]** TPK, man.

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:49]** We never had one.

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:50]** Let's do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:50]** Okay, so.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:53]** I spent so much time making Treme.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:55]** Well, Rolo, that's your turn, right?

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:56]** You cast it.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:56]** Yeah, that's it.

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:58]** Stabilize and you step back.

**[00:39:58 - 00:40:01]** Thaddeus, it's now your turn.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:05]** And before you say anything else, you need to roll a fortitude save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:07]** So what is the range on this radiation?

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:08]** Wait, how far?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:09]** At least 15.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:11]** It's 15 feet.

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:13]** Yeah, this thing is crazy.

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:14]** Fortitude.

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:15]** So what is it that I've drawn?

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:15]** Fortitude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:17]** Fortitude.

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:17]** Ah!

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:19]** You are also weakened.

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:20]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:23]** Okay, so what is... Okay, I'll look it up.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:25]** Movement speed reduced, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:25]** Oh, my God.

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:26]** This is terrible.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:28]** Should have been level two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:29]** I'm on your side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:30]** But I'm not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:32]** Took all of our hit points in that last build.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:36]** That was totally balanced.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:36]** Hey, look at that.

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:39]** You guys each found a healing serum in your pocket.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:41]** I don't know how many we have left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:43]** We have one, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:44]** I think we have one.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:45]** Yeah, we have one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:47]** 14 million possible timelines.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:47]** For me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:48]** Yep.

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:49]** Only one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:49]** Okay.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:51]** So it's Thaddeus.

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:51]** What are you doing now?

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:53]** You're on the afflictions.

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:56]** You have to add a constitution poison if you're going to do it on hero.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:56 - 00:41:00]** You also have to take three points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:00]** Yes.

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:02]** Okay.

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:02]** All right.

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:02]** Hold on.

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:07]** So the victim is shaken and the DCs of his spells and special abilities decrease by two.

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:08]** Blah, blah, blah.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:09]** Shake it.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:14]** So I'm adding the... I thought it was weakened, right?

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:14]** Condition.


## Speaker_0

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:15]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:15]** Yeah.

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:19]** Oh, if you're shaken, by the way, minus two penalties to attack rolls.

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:20]** I'm shaken and weakened?

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:21]** Is that correct?

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:24]** No, you're on the weakened step of the track.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:28]** So if you're shaken... So you take a minus two to attack.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:29]** Not even coming up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:29]** Can I?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:35]** I can't add it for some reason in Hero Lab, so I'll just... It doesn't exist in Hero Lab.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:36]** Anyway, all right.

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:37]** What doesn't exist?

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:38]** Minus two to attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:38]** It does.

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:39]** You have to go to afflictions.

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:41]** I did, but it's not there.

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:43]** Okay, constitution poison.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:45]** You have to add a constitution poison.

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:51]** Then once it's added, you have to click on it and go down to the bottom, and it'll say the step that you're on, and it should say weakened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:54]** And it'll show you the other steps you could possibly get to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:56]** Yeah, or we can just look them up in the book.

**[00:41:58 - 00:41:59]** And knowing that we're going to die.

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:04]** I want to know if I'm okay now that I'm outside of the radiation field, which I think I am.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:10]** Um, from the way that I read it, you will no longer have to do, you're no longer being affected by radiation.

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:17]** So you don't need to do a fortitude save for the radiation, but you are still weakened from the radiation.

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:18]** I don't think so.

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:20]** I don't think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:38]** because that radiation is complicated i could be wrong but that's not how i played it when we were doing the troll fight because as soon as it leaves you are just no longer like on that track like you're not affected by the poison i think yes kelly go ahead okay so thaddeus like shouts to rolo


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:46]** Roller, this thing has about maybe 30 feet of range and 15 feet is its radiation poisoning sort of ability.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:54]** Why don't we kite him both directions and just shoot at range over and over and over and create a battle of attrition?

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:56]** You pull him first.

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:57]** He's too close for me.

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:58]** Get as far as you can.

**[00:42:58 - 00:43:06]** Shaq, if you have an opportunity and you have any serums, I recommend you might heal Tormadin if you ever get a chance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:07]** Got it, whips.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:10]** All right, here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:14]** I think you need to move out of range.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:17]** Well, did you roll your fortitude save?

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:17]** Oh, you did.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:18]** You failed it.

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:19]** Sorry, I'm reading.

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:20]** I can't do two things at once.

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:27]** It says a creature that leaves an area suffused with radiation is essentially cured of the poison effect.

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:33]** Ending the source of radiation or causing, casting, remove radioactivity does the same thing.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:44]** As usual, for poison effects, an affected character creature requires rest to recover from radiation poisoning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:46]** Cool.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:47]** Which makes sense.

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:53]** So he's no longer being affected by the poison, but it's effects that have already taken place on his body.

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:55]** He has to rest to get them back.

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:57]** He doesn't just immediately get back those hit points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:58 - 00:44:00]** You just don't go further up the track if I'm out of range.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:01]** I think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:03]** Well, no, you're off the track entirely.

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:09]** So if you re-enter, you would start at the beginning, not from weekend.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:10]** Oh, fantastic.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:11]** That's great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:13]** Okay.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:17]** But I'm still shaken because I've been on it, right?

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:19]** I think so until you rest to recover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:20]** Sure.

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:26]** So the DC for that ability should also be lower because he's sluggish, if I'm reading this right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:28]** Oh, you might be right.

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:31]** Yes, the DC for all of this was two lower than it should have been.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:34]** Ooh, this is so complicated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:35]** And he rolled an 11.

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:37]** So you did pass.

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:38]** Oh, so he passed.


## Speaker_0

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:38]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:43]** 13 Fortitude would give you... You met it, and the roller gets advantage, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:44]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:46]** So you passed, and I'm sorry for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:47]** Nice.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:48]** Good catch, Vinny.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:51]** So Thaddeus, you get your three points back.

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:53]** You are not on the track.

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:54]** Great.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:55]** Did Torme.

**[00:44:55 - 00:45:00]** So this is good for Torme to, oh, we need to see if you can roll a fortitude save when you're unconscious.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:05]** Remember, you take a minus two penalty to your fortitude saves if you're weakened.

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:08]** Oh, gosh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:09]** Thaddeus is not weakened.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:10]** He passed his fortitude save.

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:11]** Yeah.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:12]** So Thaddeus.


## Speaker_0

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:13]** Oh, shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:17]** Even if you succeed, you take HP damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:19]** So you're going to go back to die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:25]** So even if you successfully save, you're going to unstabilize.

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:28]** So I'm pretty much just preventing you from losing RP.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:30]** HP, not stamina.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:31]** Correct.

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:33]** Because radiation affects your HP.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:35]** Man, I really don't want to kill one of you guys already.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:37]** But Thaddeus, it is your turn.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:40]** You passed your fortune save.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:41]** You still take the minus three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:44]** And if I try to pass this guy, I'm going to occur an AOO.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:48]** If you go past it, you'll... No, because he's flat-footed.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:49]** Oh, you're right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:51]** It's flat-footed, but... But I might get radiation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:52]** You already have it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:53]** If you're still within the aura.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:55]** We need to pull Torme out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:58]** I should... Yeah, we do.

**[00:45:58 - 00:46:01]** But I feel like this thing is dumb enough where it'll probably just go... Well, I don't know.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:03]** Go after whoever's shooting it.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:04]** Yes, probably.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:06]** I feel personally offended because I'm the one playing it.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:08]** Sorry, Kevin.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:08]** It's not you.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:10]** Am I dumb enough to keep doing what you're telling me not to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:11]** But you're playing the creature.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:13]** You're not playing you.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:13]** You're playing the creature.

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:17]** So if I pass this guy, I'm not going to be affected in any negative way.

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:18]** All right, cool.

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:19]** Then he's going to do that.

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:21]** I think you just double move, dude.

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:24]** Or just move far away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:27]** Can he drag Torme's unconscious body?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:30]** I just don't think that's going to be an issue.

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:33]** I feel, oh, I could maybe drag him towards you, Shaq.

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:34]** Is that what you're getting at?

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:35]** I think that's going to be a lot.

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:37]** I'm totally metagaming here, but yeah.

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:38]** There's a certain point.

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:39]** It's going to be hard to do.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:39]** You have to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:40]** Yeah, no, don't sweat it.

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:41]** We'll pull aggro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:45]** If I go further in, then I'm kind of fucked because John can't attack him.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:47]** His range is too short.

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:48]** I've got my gun.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:51]** My gun's 100 feet, dude.

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:51]** Oh, okay.

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:52]** Dude, just... I can still shoot him.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:53]** Okay, cool.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:53]** Sweet.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:57]** Then in that case, since we're fighting him back and forth, I'm going to go further in.

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:58]** Yes.

**[00:46:58 - 00:46:59]** Okay.

**[00:46:59 - 00:46:59]** All right, cool.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:05]** And he will do that, and then he's going to get me again if I do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:12]** Okay, so just so the listener knows what's going on, the K'fok moved and attacked.

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:13]** No, sorry, it didn't attack.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:14]** No, it did.

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:16]** It attacked Treme.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:25]** Treme is unconscious, and Thaddeus is just further past Treme and deciding what to do.

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:28]** Can I take a full action and just f***ing book it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:29]** I was just looking that up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:31]** You could spend your standard action to move.

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:32]** You would definitely move twice as far.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:34]** Yes.

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:37]** You're going to incur an AOO if you do that path, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:37]** No.

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:39]** But it's flat-footed, so it won't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:39]** Flat-footed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:41]** Oh, it's flat-footed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:42]** Yeah.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:43]** Okay, cool.

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:44]** He goes here, then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:48]** So you can't pass through enemy square.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:48]** Yeah, that works.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:49]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:50]** I would move even farther.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:52]** Can I move that far?

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:57]** You can move through my square and diagonally though to around like cut around that corner, I would assume.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:58 - 00:48:01]** I never put it into the other mode that you did.

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:03]** So those arrows might not be there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:03]** Okay, this is good.

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:04]** So I'm near the truck.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:05]** All right, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:06]** Can you... Wait, hold on.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:11]** Because the thing is that he's got a 30-foot diameter around him in which, right?

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:13]** So at least one of us needs to be outside of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:25]** So Thaddeus, from where your position was, you passed your fortune save, you took a slight hit from the radiation itself, and then you just booked it and ran.

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:28]** And ran is a loose term because you're not actually using the function to run.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:32]** You did one move action to get past it and then another move action to get away from it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:33]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:35]** Yeah.

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:36]** Yeah.

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:36]** Okay.

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:37]** That is your turn.

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:39]** It is now the K'fok's turn.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:40]** Let's hope it was Jack's turn.

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:41]** Okay.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:42]** The K'fok.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:44]** Did the K'fok have two turns?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:46]** No.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:47]** Yeah, it feels like it did.

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:48]** Did it?

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:49]** Did we?

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:49]** Yeah.

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:50]** It already moved down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:51]** Yeah, it moved down to kill me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:53]** It just went before me, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:54]** And I haven't gone yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:55]** And Jack hasn't gone yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:56]** What did I do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:58]** Just saying, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:58 - 00:49:00]** Termae, Thaddeus.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:01]** When did I say the Kevok went?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:06]** I don't know, but that's when he moved down, and you were counting.

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:08]** You were like, oh, I don't know, and then that's when... You're right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:09]** I screwed that up.

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:09]** No, it's cool.

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:10]** It's okay.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:10]** It happens.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:11]** Chak, it is your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:12]** Awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:15]** And at the top of the next round, we're going to go back to the original initiative order.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:17]** Okay.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:18]** As what I have here.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:19]** Cool.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:21]** Chak, you do need to roll a Fortitude.

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:21]** Oh, what?

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:22]** He's 15 feet away.

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:23]** Is that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:24]** Yeah, I guess I am.


## Speaker_0

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:51]** balls kev you should make that aura thing 15 oh i have it but we can't see it on my you're right but we okay that's fine 15 i think you passed yeah you do pass but you still take three points of damage yikes radiation is stupid uh three points of health damage specifically yes oh my goodness are you down i know i'm darn close


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:53]** You have four hit points total?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:54]** Yeah, I had five coming in.

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:57]** Oh, man.

**[00:49:57 - 00:49:58]** Yeah, he is not about that life.

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:01]** Terme, you're good luck, sir.

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:10]** Chuck is going to... This is one of those, like, put your own oxygen mask on before you put the kids on.

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:11]** Solid advice.

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:18]** Chuck is going to move to here and pop a shot off at the K'fuck.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:19]** Yes.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:20]** Here goes nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:47]** uh i don't like that that's an 11. total total that misses with the minus two two ac yeah yeah balls cool cool balls indeed make sure next fox turn it needs to see where it's at on the poison track i'm just gonna put that out there meaning what it's gonna move again or it has to do another save it has poison in its system right i don't know how long it lasts


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:49]** Oh, man, I hate poison so much.

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:51]** F*** you all for making me use it.

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:53]** Okay, it is the end of round number one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:54]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:57]** I know I totally screwed that up, but everybody has had a turn, correct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:58]** Yes.

**[00:50:58 - 00:50:59]** It's all good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:04]** We're going to move back to the top of initiative order.

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:07]** As it was, it is Treme's turn.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:08]** He is on the ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:11]** So I can roll a fortitude save.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:15]** No, I spend a resolve to get one point of health, right?

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:16]** Yeah.

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:21]** And then I immediately will go down because of the radiation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:24]** Well, you'll have to spend another resolve point to stabilize.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:29]** So what's a mechanic where I can actually delay my turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:31]** I don't think you can do that.

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:35]** You can't take a standard action, so I don't think you can delay your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:37]** Is there a standard action to delay?

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:38]** I don't have a...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:39]** Yeah.

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:40]** Delay is a standard action.

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:43]** And since you're down, here's what I don't know.

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:48]** Do we resolve the fortitude save first or do we resolve the fact?

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:50]** I think we resolve the fortitude save since you're still within.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:54]** Then you would spend a resolve point to stabilize.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:54]** Right.

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:58]** But then I would then immediately go back down to zero no matter what.

**[00:51:58 - 00:52:04]** Well, yeah, so right now I think... And then I... Yeah, this is just... I think I'm dead.

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:05]** I'm going to take three points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:07]** No, no, no, no, no.

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:07]** You're far from it.

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:09]** Well, not far from it.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:09]** You're not dead.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:11]** I'm dead.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:13]** No, no, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:15]** It doesn't say you need to do a standard action to delay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:19]** It needs to move, which it will likely do because you're on the ground.

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:24]** You're going to take three points of damage, which in this case would just mean that you're going to drop.

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:25]** To zero.

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:25]** From.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:26]** Again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:27]** Well, you're at zero.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:28]** Yes.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:29]** You're stable because I stabilized you.

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:34]** You're going to drop down to dying because you take three points of damage.

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:40]** All you're doing right now is seeing, are you going to move further down the poison track or not with the fortitude save?


## Speaker_0

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:40]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:40 - 00:53:01]** then it will be your turn and you can spend a resolve point to stabilize again so here's here's why i think the radiation resolves first okay because under stabilizing it doesn't specify when in your turn you're supposed to use it or you have to use it however the radiation does talk about at the beginning of your next turn yeah you take the


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:15]** damage so I take the damage now at zero health points I will say I just read delay and it just says if you don't know what you're doing don't know what you're gonna do on your turn you can just delay it it does not say anything about a standard action so I will let you delay I'm gonna delay my turn I


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:16]** Cool.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:18]** Special initiative actions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:19]** Wait, can I?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:19]** Okay.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:20]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:21]** Can I?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:21]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:22]** GM call.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:23]** I think, right?

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:26]** Or am I reading some poor source?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:28]** Is delay turn not under standard action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:29]** It's under other actions.

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:31]** Not even like swift or reaction.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:32]** Other actions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:33]** Okay.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:34]** Yeah, no, it's not under standard action at all.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:37]** Because you would take your standard action after you've delayed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:39]** It's right next to combat banter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:41]** You're just pushing yourself down the initiative order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:42]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:43]** It's in other actions.


## Speaker_0

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:44]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:46]** That's a GM call?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:47]** Yeah.

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:53]** So I wish to delay before taking any other standard action, before taking any actions on your turn.

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:55]** This does not require spending any of your actions.

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:58]** So it's not an action to delay my turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:59 - 00:53:59]** Nope.

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:00]** With that settled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:03]** Page 249, Starfinder core rulebook.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:04]** It's not your turn currently.

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:07]** Where do you want to bring back your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:09]** After this guy's turn.

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:11]** So probably... After which guy's?

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:12]** The creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:14]** After the creature's turn.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:15]** Okay.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:16]** So I need to move you down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:21]** So basically you want to do the turn over we did last round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:21]** Okay.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:25]** So Torme is laying on the ground and he's just going to hold that.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:29]** He's just on the edge of death and he's knocking on heaven's door.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:30]** But he's looking back.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:31]** He's like, I can fight this.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:32]** I can fight this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:34]** And he's going to be like... I'm just in my mind.

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:37]** I'm thinking about like... Yeah, because you're unconscious.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:38]** What I can do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:40]** And you just like, you start chatting with the angel.

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:43]** So what if I don't want to go back right away?

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:46]** And the angel's like, yeah, I think you can chill.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:47]** And it's actually Thaddeus' turn.

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:49]** All right.

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:51]** He is not within that aura.

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:55]** But before you take any of your actions, we have to call game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:56]** All right.

**[00:54:58 - 00:54:58]** Dang.

**[00:54:58 - 00:54:58]** Wow.

**[00:54:58 - 00:54:59]** That's a tough fight.

**[00:54:59 - 00:54:59]** Yeah.

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:02]** This might be our most rules-heavy episode ever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:06]** Man, radiation sucks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:10]** Thanks for listening, you scallywags.

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:15]** Until next week, drift beacons and distant stars.
