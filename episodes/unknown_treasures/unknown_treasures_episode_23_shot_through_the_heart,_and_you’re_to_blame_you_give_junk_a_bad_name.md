## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:00:01 - 00:00:13]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:13]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:15]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:16]** Get out.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:20]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:22]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:22 - 00:00:30]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales of the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:33]** Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:00:56 - 00:01:01]** Welcome back to We'll Save in the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:01:01 - 00:01:05]** I'm Kevin, your GM, and this is Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:07 - 00:01:08]** What's the treasure?

**[00:01:09 - 00:01:09]** What's the treasure, Kevin?

**[00:01:09 - 00:01:10]** I don't know.

**[00:01:10 - 00:01:11]** It's the friends you make while at work.

**[00:01:11 - 00:01:11]** No.

**[00:01:11 - 00:01:12]** That's right.

**[00:01:12 - 00:01:13]** Yes, it is.

**[00:01:13 - 00:01:16]** It's going to be some nice rum at the end or something like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:16 - 00:01:18]** It's a lifetime supply of Kefauk dogs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:01:21 - 00:01:22]** I don't want to play anymore.

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:26]** With the hole through the center of the Kefauk dog so you can drink your beer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:26 - 00:01:29]** Apparently, is this really a popular fucking thing?

**[00:01:29 - 00:01:30]** Because I've seen pictures of it.

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:32]** Hot dogs are popular?

**[00:01:33 - 00:01:35]** No, like the drinking beer through your hot dog situation.

**[00:01:35 - 00:01:37]** Drinking beer through a glizzy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:39]** No, it was like a viral video.

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:41]** That's all.

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:42]** Hopefully it stays that way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:44]** Please don't do that.

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:45]** Watch out for your health.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:47]** Next time that we're at a convention.

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:50]** I'm going to do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:52]** It sounds dumb, but I'm going to do it.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:53]** I'm going to walk away from you if you do that.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:55]** Just full of glizzies.

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:55]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:59]** Just full of hot dogs.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:00]** That's disgusting.

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:02]** Take that whatever way you want, listener.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:04]** Yeah.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:04]** Yeah.

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:09]** Just five hot dogs chilling out, getting hot.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:26]** maybe there'll be a six by then well that was the worst that was horrible cool is there anything else that we can talk about yeah okay there's plenty of other things we can talk about we could but we were recounting earlier in Indianapolis when we went to Gen Con um

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:30]** Heads up for the random people that we actually saw that listened to us in Gen Con, which is kind of cool.

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:37]** But Will, apparently, we booked a bunch of stuff, and I might be telling this in a Kelly retelling, and I might miss some details, Will.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:42]** But basically, we roll up at the hotel, and Will is just like, you know what, f*** this.

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:43]** Earlier reservation.

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:44]** I want the sweet.

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:47]** So then like he gets like some sweet like up there.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:53]** He just like takes off his monocle and like gives him like a thousand bucks and then he goes up there.

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:57]** And then I think this was the night before John and I and maybe Kevin too like rolled in.

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:01]** And then like the next day.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:06]** we saw Will and then everyone at the hotel was looking at Will in a really weird way.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:12]** It was kind of like an expression of like, hey, that's really cool that that's Will and also, oh my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:18]** Kind of like one of those weird little... And then the security guard... It was like he was some kind of celebrity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:19]** Yeah, he was.

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:20]** Awe and fear.

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:21]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:23]** Which I'm not saying Will's not a celebrity, but...

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:26]** Definitely not in that capacity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:28]** He's kind of like Smaug the dragon.

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:35]** Like, you know how like you're like over a bunch of gold and he's kind of majestic, but at the same time he could burn down your entire village.

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:36]** And I think that's how everyone kind of felt.

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:44]** So then like the security guard too was talking and he was like, wow, man, you last night were, that was a crazy night.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:44 - 00:04:12]** all these people at the bar knew him too like he bought a bunch of drinks for them or something I don't remember this but am I right John that really did happen oh no this is accurate it was like the night afterwards that we ended up at the bar ourselves and there was that weird couple they knew him didn't they and then the bartender we were staying in a weird hotel I always think people are weird that aren't weird Kevin but yeah go ahead they were weird they're all weird


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:17]** We didn't fit the dress code, though, but it was cool because I knew the security guard from earlier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:20]** We got so many dirty looks, actually.

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:21]** For real.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:23]** With our Will Save t-shirts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:26]** But how did you know the security guard?

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:28]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:29]** I made friends with him.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:35]** See, look, if you go to a place, you go to a strange town, you've never been there before, make friends.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:36]** Yeah.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:44]** This is a bad thing on me, but when I used to go clubbing in my days, I used to make sure I was friends with the bouncers.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:45]** Yeah.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:47]** Because sometimes they got you in for free.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:50]** Other times, they'd save you from fights.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:52]** Other times, they'd just punch a guy for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:56]** Well, there was this one brawl in this one bar.

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:57]** I think it was called The Page.

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:58]** I'm pretty sure it got shut down a few years ago.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:00]** Anyways...

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:04]** we were all hanging out and we were doing like suit up Saturdays.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:07]** So we would wear, you know, nice suits to the club.

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:14]** And, um, it was like somebody was hitting on one of our girlfriends and somebody else pushed.

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:17]** And then it got to literally just a brawl that cleared the dance floor.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:24]** And they like grabbed the other guys pointed at me and was like, dude, and threw the other guys out and came over to me.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:26]** We're like, you can't be doing that, man.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:29]** And I was like, I didn't start it.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:30]** Like, uh,

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:33]** But the bouncers were cool with me, so they automatically threw the other guys out.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:35]** Anyways, that's my story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:36]** I enjoyed that.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:40]** Maybe that's what Will did, because he literally forgot everything that night, though.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:41]** He doesn't remember anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:53]** Well, look, we were at a fancy... We were at the Columbia Club, just for our listeners, which was a really old hotel and monument circle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:54]** It was like the Ritz in 1802.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:58]** Yeah, and we had no idea, and we were like, we need some hotels.

**[00:05:58 - 00:05:59]** It's got all this...

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:00]** Yeah.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:01]** Pedigree that we didn't know about.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:09]** And, you know, if you're if you're walking into a private sort of establishment, especially the rules are different.

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:10]** The rules are different.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:17]** If you can make friends and I'm not saying flash some cash, but if you get it doesn't hurt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:18]** I think you did do that.

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:20]** That's another thing that happened.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:20]** Yeah.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:22]** But like you didn't remember it.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:26]** And then I think that like when John arrived, he found you in a bathtub with sunglasses on.

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:27]** Is that what happened?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:30]** Just passed out with some alcohol?

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:33]** A soaked bathrobe in the bathtub with sunglasses on.

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:36]** That was a staged photo.

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:36]** Oh, okay.

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:38]** Quote, unquote, staged.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:39]** Staged, yeah.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:42]** It was just a couple of hot dogs getting hot in the hot tub.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:48]** There was definitely some glizzies or some groupies in the hot tub with a security guard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:48 - 00:07:14]** yeah i would love the will save groupies come on can i who would that even be oh go on yeah yeah i don't know i would just say i would love to be a bouncer for a night and just see how hard of a job it is because i'm sure it is very tough but seems also fascinating because you just talk to a lot of people you get a good slice life that's a good thing like you get a good cross-section of humanity yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:19]** You get to flex a little bit, but it strikes me as one of the most thankless jobs.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:21]** Absolutely.

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:24]** Everyone you deal with is just belligerent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:25]** Yeah.

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:28]** This episode goes out to all you.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:29]** All you bouncers out there.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:30]** All you bouncers.

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:32]** All the bouncers in one air pod.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:33]** Thank you for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:33]** Yeah.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:35]** Inventory.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:37]** What is it?

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:40]** When you catch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:43]** Oh, the inventory management or security.

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:43]** Yeah.

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:43]** Theft.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:44]** Yeah.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:45]** Loss protection.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:46]** Loss prevention.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:48]** Loss prevention.

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:49]** Loss prevention.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:51]** Loss prevention.

**[00:07:51 - 00:08:04]** loss prevention is definitely not on the same level no no no but I'm sure they see some wild stuff too plenty of people who are drunk and also probably inebriated with other things


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:07]** If you're a bouncer and you see us rolling up, just let us in.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:12]** We will be taking some clothes.

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:13]** And we won't cause any problems.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:16]** Don't make us go in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:21]** If you're loss prevention at the Kohl's down the street, it's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:22]** Just let us in.

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:25]** That's our new model.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:27]** Just let us in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:30]** Now let us out.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:46]** but Kevin to your story I definitely want to go clubbing with you if that's how I want you to like fight some people I got kids now I can't do that kind of stuff just one time true that's right Kevin turns into a pumpkin at midnight not to Andy he doesn't

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:47]** Yeah.

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:52]** Oh, that's why it gets so aggravated when the mid-stroke midnight happens.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:52]** Have you noticed that?

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:54]** It was 2 a.m.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:54]** It was 2 a.m.

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:56]** But it was like midnight here.

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:58]** He turned into a different person.

**[00:08:58 - 00:08:59]** He's like, it's almost 12 a.m.

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:00]** L.A.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:00]** time.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:01]** I need to get to bed so they don't know.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:02]** That's right.

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:03]** Oh, you're right.

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:05]** It was midnight L.A.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:06]** Fucking Kevin, man.

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:06]** 2 a.m.

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:07]** Kevin is amazing.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:08]** It's dangerous.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:09]** I don't like it.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:09]** It's dangerous.

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:11]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:11]** Okay, cool.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:14]** So we'll just have a we'll save outing where we go clubbing.

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:17]** Vinny and I have lots of club experience.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:30]** So what I want to happen, since I'm the shortest person in the group, we all need to suit up and I want the four of you to stand pillars around me and act like I'm important.

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:31]** I'll do it.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:38]** Just for our listeners, I don't know if we talked about this on air before, but I am officially the smallest person in this group at 5'10".


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:40]** As if that's small, but yeah.

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:41]** Yeah.

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:41]** Yeah.

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:42]** You are.

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:45]** We'll get you one of those chairs that sits on rods.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:53]** Apparently a bunch of people in Silicon Valley are getting leg lengthening surgery.

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:54]** Leg extensions?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:55]** Okay, dude.

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:56]** I've heard about that.

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:56]** For real?

**[00:09:57 - 00:09:59]** You can get tall as f*** with those.

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:00]** I was thinking about doing it.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:02]** People have grown like feet and feet and feet from like that.

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:03]** Yeah.

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:04]** I was surprised.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:06]** I think this should be our first Patreon.

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:06]** Dude, Will, no.

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:07]** Don't dare.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:08]** Is to get Kev above six feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:09]** Rude.

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:10]** No, I'm fine where I'm at.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:11]** This is it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:12]** It's only two inches, dude.

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:13]** It'd be like one freaking procedure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:14]** Yeah.

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:17]** But I think that's definitely something in Starfinder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:20]** One procedure that they break both of your fingers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:21]** Yeah, they do.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:21]** They do.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:21]** Yeah.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:22]** It's crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:23]** It's really painful to heal.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:25]** It's not like an in and out filling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:28]** Yeah, you're not going to be playing basketball after that.

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:31]** Just look like you can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:34]** You're not going to be walking after that for a hot minute.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:35]** That's true.

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:38]** But it could be worth it.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:43]** I mean, I say as a six foot four man, that juice is not worth the squeeze.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:47]** Trust us, the people over six feet, that it's not worth it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:51]** Look, being tall comes with pulling things off high shelves.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:54]** That is my role to society.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:55]** And bad posture.

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:57]** And bad posture.

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:57]** At least for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:58]** Leaning down on people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:59]** Kelly and I were just talking about this.

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:09]** When you meet people who are significantly taller than you, and you are already tall, it is the weirdest thing to be like, hey, yeah, totally, for sure.

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:11]** Yeah, I'm looking up at you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:12]** It's surreal, man.

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:16]** It's like the time I saw Shaq in Westwood.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:17]** Oh, really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:19]** How tall is he?

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:21]** He's actually only like 4'8".


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:25]** He looked like he could eat someone who's 4'8".

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:27]** Yeah, he's Kevin Hart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:32]** He's like a giant from Skyrim, basically.

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:37]** Question is, is Shaq going to come out and help us in this fight, Kev?

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:38]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:40]** Can we have a cameo, dude?

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:45]** You've twisted the story around enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:45]** We can do a Shaq.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:47]** Is he fighting in the arena?

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:49]** Like, what are we doing here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:49]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:50]** Is he fighting?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:53]** He does not have his Shaq Fu skills for sure.

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:55]** Shaq Fu.

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:56]** That'd be awesome.

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:57]** Slam dunk contest?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:57 - 00:11:58]** Well, let's see.

**[00:11:58 - 00:11:59]** He might be in the game.

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:00]** We'll find out.

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:00]** Okay.

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:01]** Let's play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:02]** I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:03]** Let's play.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:04]** Let's play.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:05]** All right.

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:15]** So before Shaq joined us, last time you pilfered through the camp of a Vesk survivalist by the name of Zethelred.

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:24]** You picked up some spell gems, armor, a rubbish cannon, and his datapad, and you were able to get into the datapad and read Zethelred's journal.

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:32]** He's pretty much a big game hunter, and his last entry was collected supplies, backslash, backslash, junk construct.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:38]** Then you recheck your coordinates with Vario 13 and continue towards the Stellar Flare.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:40]** This led you to the dead end.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:41]** A dead end.

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:43]** It's called the dead end in the book.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:45]** Spoiler.

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:45]** Yeah, spoiler.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:50]** And there were two Keshtis toying with the K'vok carcass.

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:57]** Chak snuck up for a better position, but Thaddeus came stumbling in with that new armor of his, and the fight was on.

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:05]** At first, the Akesti fired three magic missiles, but Torme caught them.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:08]** using a Witch Word racial ability.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:15]** The rest of you missed all your shots, and then Termay threw those magic missiles back at that Akesh-T.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:17]** Two of those magic missiles.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:18]** Just two.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:19]** He still has one more in his hand.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:23]** For a total of nine points of damage.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:27]** And the big question was, is this Akesh-T dead?

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:29]** with only taking nine points of damage.

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:31]** Let's take it to that.

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:32]** Let's say yes.

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:33]** Yeah, you okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:34]** Yeah.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:35]** What happened?

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:37]** Is this a vote?

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:38]** Like, yes, dead.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:39]** Oh, I vote yes.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:39]** I vote yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:42]** I don't think that's how that works.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:43]** When the screen loads, I'm going to see him dead.

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:44]** I'm just waiting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:48]** Does it make any difference if we know what the Akechi's job was?

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:51]** Because, like, were they loss prevention?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:51]** He looks dead.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:57]** They actually, if you look closely at their shirts, it says loss prevention.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:57 - 00:14:05]** and the kafak has stolen yeah they killed it but it's got it's got like the no symbol with the outline of kafak in it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:09]** Did I not reveal these things to you?

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:10]** Where were you guys earlier?

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:11]** I thought I did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:16]** All that you revealed now for the listeners is that there's a red X over at the K'vok.

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:20]** There's also a hand-drawn red X and then a big question mark.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:23]** Yeah, I didn't draw those.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:24]** That was Will's sketches.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:26]** Combat?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:28]** Oh, it's an Akechi Technomancer.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:30]** This is what the Akechis look like.

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:32]** He looks awesome.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:34]** They look great.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:36]** And he looks like big and buff, right?

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:40]** It's this big buff lizard with spikes going down its back and a long red tail.

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:42]** Yeah, only wearing pants.

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:43]** Only pants.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:45]** Like an armband across their chest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:47]** He has a nice chest, man.

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:47]** I gotta say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:52]** But much like Shaq, he looks very large, but they're actually a small creature.

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:54]** That's what it is.


## Speaker_0

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:55]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:58]** That's the connection that we were hoping for.

**[00:14:58 - 00:15:00]** You never see Charles Buckley and Shaq in the same room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:05]** And it's interesting enough, both of these Acastys are named Shaq, spelled differently.


## Speaker_0

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:06]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:10]** Not to be confused with our check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:12]** Right, so check, check, and check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:15]** Well, how do I get rid of this X on him?

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:16]** Because that's definitely not real.

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:18]** Let me take this big question mark away.

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:20]** And guess what?

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:23]** It is now that Akeshi's turn.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:25]** Still alive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:28]** Bombs prevention has high constitution.

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:30]** My God, who would have known?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:33]** So let me see here.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:37]** once per day as a move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:38]** This doesn't sound good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:53]** The Keshti can squirt blood from one of their eyes at a foe within 30 feet, making a ranged attack against them to hit KAC, and if successfully hits, it grants the ally harrying fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:56]** So it wants harrying fire?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:58 - 00:16:00]** For the other Keshti, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:01]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:02]** Got it.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:03]** What is your KAC?

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:05]** Because I definitely hit it.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:07]** That's a 25.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:08]** Oh.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:12]** Against... Just hit.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:13]** 25.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:14]** Just barely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:15]** Just barely.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:16]** Just barely hits.

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:20]** It's Herring Fire for the next one.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:21]** But that was a move action.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:27]** And now, as a standard action, it's going to shoot Magic Missile.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:27]** What?

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:28]** At Rolo.

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:30]** You could just not...

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:32]** I could not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:34]** Yeah.

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:34]** No.

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:38]** I'm going to decline that invitation.

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:38]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:42]** Do you have any kind of racial ability that lets you decline magic missiles?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:46]** Yeah, it's called law prevention.

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:46]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:54]** Well, prevent a total of bam, bam, five, six, seven points of damage to your face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:59]** Why don't you just wait a minute?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:00]** Seven, you said?

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:02]** Yeah, is there some kind of lucky number you got?

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:05]** Oh, you hit me with a seven, so I get to negate that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:11]** So, thanks to being a precog, I have an ability called Safeguard.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:28]** And by analyzing the battlefield and noting in that moment and making my new dexterous moves, I could see just far enough ahead to know that I need to move a little to the left and it still hits me because I can reduce it by five damage.

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:29]** Ooh.

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:32]** So as a reaction to, yes.

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:32]** Okay.

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:34]** Have I used my reaction on this turn?

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:35]** I don't, I don't think so.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:36]** I don't believe you did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:37]** Okay.

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:39]** Is this the first round of combat?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:43]** Ooh, no, it's technically the second.

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:46]** But Rolu hasn't gone yet.

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:49]** Is that just... He's already had his first move.

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:51]** He's had his first move, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:57]** Do you just not get a reaction in the first round of combat, or can you not make an AOO in the first round of combat?

**[00:17:57 - 00:18:00]** Because I think you can still have a reaction, but you can't make an AOO, right?

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:01]** Your AOO is a reaction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:02]** Right.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:05]** An AOL is a reaction, but a reaction is not an AOL.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:05]** Exactly.

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:06]** Cool.

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:08]** All right, so I reduce it by two.

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:09]** Sorry to hold things up.

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:13]** Sorry, I reduce it by five to two.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:14]** Right, Kev?

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:14]** Two.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:16]** Two points of damage to your face.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:17]** Two points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:18]** Still on your face, though.

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:20]** Still on my face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:24]** Wait, the herring fire was towards me, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:26]** Yep, so you're marked with Herring Fire.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:27]** Mocked.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:28]** Mocked.

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:30]** You've been mocked.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:31]** I believe they get a plus two.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:33]** I'd have to look it up.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:35]** Anyways, Rolu, it's your turn.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:37]** Of course it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:39]** All right, Rolu.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:42]** It's pissed.

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:47]** Because I feel like some of it may be chipped away a little bit of his mask.

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:49]** And you can see a little bit of the skin underneath.

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:53]** And he reaches up with one of his hands.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:58]** And he feels this chip there.

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:02]** So he's going to, that is a close range.

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:04]** He's going to, can I make this?

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:06]** No, I need to step up.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:19]** He's going to take a step forward about 10, 15 feet, and he is going to cast Injury Echo on the Keshti that we thought was dead.

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:22]** And I need you to make a... Wheel save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:24]** Wheel save!

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:26]** Wheel save!

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:29]** I will make a wheel save.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:35]** That's 12.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:37]** Total 12.

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:38]** Total 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:40]** Too bad you needed a 13.

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:40]** Dang.

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:43]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:44]** So satisfying.

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:52]** Maybe you can think of whatever injury from the target's future or past causes them to take one point of damage.

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:53]** Ha, ha, ha.

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:55]** Ha, ha.

**[00:19:56 - 00:20:00]** You laugh like Will when he takes his monocle off.

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:05]** I own the box place now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:07]** You moved and then did that magic nonsense?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:12]** Yeah, I moved and then cast that spell, and then I already used my reaction this turn, so that's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:13]** Cool.

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:14]** Chuck, it's now your turn.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:18]** Chuck is feeling ballsy.

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:22]** Sounds upsetting.

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:31]** He's going to run up, and he's going to move to here and say, Don't you dare shoot at my friends!

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:37]** at the northerly technomancer.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:37]** The northerly.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:43]** The northerly technomancer using his not in the face action ability.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:45]** Not in the face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:47]** So nice.

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:48]** Which does what?

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:50]** Oh, make a will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:50]** Will save.

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:52]** Will save.

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:52]** Okay.

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:53]** Okay.

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:56]** Kelly, your will saves are always late.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:57]** It's a 20.

**[00:20:57 - 00:20:58]** Just perfect.

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:00]** Dirty 20.

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:01]** It's the cherry on top.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:02]** Dirty 20.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:03]** Cool.

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:04]** It just has no effect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:09]** This is all working out according to Kip's plan.

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:10]** I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:11]** Check braces for impact.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:16]** All right, Thaddeus, it's now your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:17]** Oh, my God.

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:18]** All right.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:23]** Thaddeus is going to take a full round to just shoot his Venom caster at this guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:26]** How many poison darts do you have left?

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:27]** And are you using them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:28]** I'm not.

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:31]** They're not loaded at this particular moment.

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:33]** That's a 22 is one of them.

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:35]** 22 to hit?

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:36]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:37]** That's including your minus four?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:38]** Yes.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:38]** No.

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:40]** So that's an 18 to hit.

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:44]** And then it's like an 18 and a 12.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:46]** So it is an 18 hit and a 12 as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:48]** Wait, say again?

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:50]** So it was a 22 minus four is 18.

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:51]** Correct.

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:54]** And then your second shot was 12?

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:55]** 16 minus four is 12.

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:58]** And you're shooting for KAC?

**[00:21:59 - 00:21:59]** Yes.

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:01]** So the 18 hits.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:01]** Fantastic.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:02]** You hit once.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:07]** And you're shooting at the second Akesh-T, right?

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:08]** The one that's for the north?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:08]** Yes.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:09]** Okay.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:10]** So I'm going to roll for damage.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:15]** And that's three points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:18]** Three points damage.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:20]** Uh-uh-uh.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:21]** Chipping away.

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:24]** That's 42 points now.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:25]** Okay.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:26]** Moving on.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:27]** That is the end of Thaddeus' turn.

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:29]** It is now that second of Kesti's turn.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:32]** And just looking up Herring Fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:37]** Is the second Akechdi the northerly or southerly Akechdi?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:38]** Northerly.

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:42]** The one you guys presumed dead after one hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:43]** Wait, I thought that was the southerly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:45]** Yeah, I thought it was the southerly.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:47]** The southerly is the first Akechdi.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:50]** Which one was the one that we thought was dead that took nine damage last round or whatever?

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:51]** The first Akechdi to the south.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:52]** Oh, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:53]** Yeah.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:53]** The one to the north.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:54]** Yeah.

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:55]** The one in the north.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:56]** The one in the north.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:58]** In the north.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:58 - 00:22:58]** Read Herringfire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:00]** Read Herringfire.

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:11]** But the next ally to attack that foe gains a plus two circumstance bonus to her next attack roll as long as it takes place before their next turn.

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:13]** Your next turn because it's in.

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:18]** So that Akesh-T is going to move down to get a clear shot.

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:20]** Bum, bum, bum.

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:24]** Steps right on top of the Kafak.

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:27]** Does it still have a clear shot?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:29]** I like that.

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:34]** I think it has to move out here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:34]** Sure.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:35]** Is that better?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:41]** Because you're saying this is what... Tactically speaking, it is better for me.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:41]** Thank you.

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:45]** The calmness with which he said that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:48]** Are you sure it wasn't difficult terrain to move through the kefauk?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:52]** I am positive it was not difficult to train to move the Kefak.

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:58]** And now I do a ranged attack against your EAC.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:04]** My ranged attack is a... I didn't write it down.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:05]** I'm terrible at this game.

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:08]** Just make it up.

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:08]** I know.

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:11]** It's a plus 42 to hit.

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:12]** That works.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:13]** 42 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:16]** Range is plus 6.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:19]** No, that's a joke, Ray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:20]** 12 to hit EAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:22]** Oh, that's a fail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:25]** Yeah.

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:32]** He points his finger at you and goes... Oh, wait, but he gets a plus 2 circumstance bonus, so it's actually a 14.

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:33]** Does a 14 EAC hit?

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:34]** Yes.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:36]** So 14 hits.

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:37]** Pick a number.

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:39]** Come on, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:41]** Come on, Kev.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:41]** Jeez.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:43]** Let me just invent a rule real quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:47]** No, it's literally he squirted blood on you, and that would give you a hearing fire.

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:49]** I just read it off to you less than five minutes ago.

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:49]** You're right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:50]** I'm just joking.

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:51]** We're just giving you shit, Kev.

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:54]** You can't give us shit and then not be able to take shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:54 - 00:25:02]** So squirts blood all over you, and then the other Keshi steps forward, and you see him point his finger like a witch, and he goes...

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:28]** and it takes you take 1d3 of acid damage oh do i want to do acid i can choose whatever cold acid or electricity or fire will you acid it is that's a six on the die so you get three points of damage acid type that's it that's your turn kiff yeah that's my turn it's a pretty exciting turn


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:29]** It was whatever.

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:36]** I mean, I'm just saying you're not really wowed by our turns, so I don't know how I want to be wowed by your turns.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:38]** Am I supposed to be wowed by your turns?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:40]** Yeah, because we're the heroes here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:43]** Not these Cashties.

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:45]** That's true.

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:46]** We're the main characters, Kevin.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:48]** Just so that they know.

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:49]** Are you, though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:51]** I'm the main character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:52]** Again with the presumptions.

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:55]** You're just assuming that you're the main character.

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:56]** Just saying.

**[00:25:57 - 00:26:00]** Shock 1 and Shock 2 are actually the main characters of this game.

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:02]** They've just been waiting for you.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:06]** I wonder what heroic things they're up to.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:12]** It's Vary's turn, but Vary's going to stay back in the back and do nothing.

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:14]** So Treme, you're up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:21]** So I have a rules clarification question, and I'm just looking for a ruling from Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:26]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:26]** Nailed it, right?

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:26]** No.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:43]** Well, last time on Wheel Save, we said that I couldn't, as a standard action, because I caught three for whatever reason, I couldn't use all three, even as a full action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:46]** No, we said you could use all four, technically.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:46]** You can make two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:50]** I have two that I can make on my own.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:52]** Barehanded, yeah.

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:54]** As long as you have two empty hands, you can make two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:54]** Yes.

**[00:26:55 - 00:27:00]** And I have one with me that I have an extra one.

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:02]** Can I just toss one and not expend the two?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:11]** If you toss the one you're already holding, I believe that falls under your racial ability, the other racial ability.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:13]** So would that be a standard action still?

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:15]** Could I double attack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:16]** I don't have it in front of me.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:17]** I'd have to bring it up again.

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:19]** What does it say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:26]** It doesn't say anything because I feel like this is uncharted territory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:30]** Well, it says as a standard action, you can create two and throw them.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:33]** And then it says, also, if you caught one, you can throw it.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:34]** So, right?

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:35]** Is that how it's worded?

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:38]** So, if that's how it's worded, that also requires the standard action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:39]** Because you fire two missiles.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:40]** I mean, okay.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:44]** You want to... You can throw additional force bolts from each hand.

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:46]** Absorb force.

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:47]** As a reaction.

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:48]** Maximum of two.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:49]** Which word can...

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:53]** catch missiles fired at it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:56]** So that's absorbed force.

**[00:27:57 - 00:28:02]** What you want to read is force bolt, which is you can throw from each free hand.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:06]** If you've absorbed, you can throw those two for free.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:12]** In addition to the original force bolt.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:18]** So you'd have to do the standard action to do at least one force bolt before you can throw the second one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:19]** For free, correct.

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:22]** That's how it reads for me.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:23]** Sorry, I don't follow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:28]** So you have four arms, and you caught three of these things.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:34]** Then last time you technically used force bolt, but you didn't create two new ones.

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:38]** So you threw the two that you had as your standard action.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:42]** This time you're saying, can I throw the one for free?

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:43]** The answer is no.

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:45]** No, I don't mean for free.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:50]** So I can't throw it and attack again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:57]** You could attack with three bolts this time because it would be two free hands and in addition the one you caught.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:58 - 00:29:00]** So I'll allow you to throw three bolts.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:05]** What if I just want to expend the one and save my force bolt for another time?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:07]** Then that's going to still cost a standard action.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:09]** Does anybody else have something to add?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:15]** The energy lasts six rounds or until it is used to create an additional force bolt.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:19]** So yeah, I think now because...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:29]** Because if three is a full action and two is a standard action, I feel like... No, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:31]** That's Magic Missile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:33]** Magic Missile... This is the same thing as Magic Missile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:34]** No, it's different.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:43]** Okay, well, when I added it, I never added Magic Missile to my hero lab, but then it's like, this is the same spell as Magic Missile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:53]** Right, it acts the same as Magic Missile, but the way it's saying it is the standard action is throwing two of your own, and in addition, you can throw two more if you caught them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:58]** Yeah, for every two that you caught, you can use the force bolt ability again.

**[00:29:58 - 00:30:00]** So you can use force bolt once per day.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:03]** For every two that you catch, you can use it again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:11]** So I have basically the option to use my additional magic force bolt as a full action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:16]** No, as a standard action, you would throw two, and then you'd throw an additional one for free.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:20]** But I can't throw an additional one for free by itself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:25]** No, because you'd have to do it with a standard action of throwing something else.

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:28]** So I'll let you throw the one, but it's going to take a standard action to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:32]** Yeah, so that's useless to me because I wanted to attack twice.

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:36]** But it is guaranteed damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:37]** Yep.

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:37]** Sure.

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:42]** That's more than not all of us can say that we've hit all the time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:45]** Catch, buddy.

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:47]** And I'm just going to do all three.

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:55]** But I'm going to direct two to the other guy who just fired at me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:58]** So you're throwing one at a cash tee number one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:00]** Yeah.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:05]** The one that I got hit that hit for nine already thrown one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:06]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:11]** And then two to this bugaboo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:13]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:32]** okay so that's uh uh four for the four for the number for the for the niner we're calling him a niner oh five and eight points for eight total yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:33]** All right.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:36]** That's actually some very nice hits.

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:39]** All three hit automatically.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:42]** These Akashis aren't looking all that great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:44]** So that was a standard action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:45]** That is a standard action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:46]** So I can move still.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:48]** Yes, I believe so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:49]** Awesome.

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:51]** I'm going to move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:56]** I'm going to move over here.

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:57]** Doctor, okay.

**[00:31:57 - 00:31:59]** Where did you come from?

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:02]** Is there an Osaru here?

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:05]** Somebody from a different world, perhaps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:06]** All right.

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:08]** That was Treme's turn.

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:12]** It is now Akesh-T number one's turn again.

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:15]** Dun, dun, dun.

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:18]** Um...

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:22]** I think as a... I don't even know why I have to assume things.

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:23]** I'm going to just assume things.

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:25]** I feel like you have visible tech.

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:28]** Your rifle is made of electricity.

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:29]** Is that correct, John?

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:31]** Or it's an energy weapon?

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:33]** I don't.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:35]** I don't think so.

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:37]** It shoots energy.

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:38]** It's a laser beam.

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:38]** Laser gun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:40]** Did you draw the one and the two?

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:41]** Laser.

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:42]** It's fire damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:44]** That was me.

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:44]** I did that.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:46]** Is that correct, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:49]** Uh, I, I don't see that.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:50]** Oh yes.

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:51]** No.

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:51]** Give it backwards.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:54]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:55]** Um, uh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:57]** So all I'm, all I'm saying is it, it looks technological.

**[00:32:58 - 00:32:59]** Would you consider that technological weapon?

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:00]** Yeah.

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:04]** Um, and so, uh, this, a cash T is going to go.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:07]** Right here.

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:09]** Right in front of you.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:10]** Just marches up.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:12]** Takes six full seconds to get there.

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:14]** Or no, three seconds to get there, right?

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:18]** And then I have to make sure I have this right.

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:20]** Not squirt blood.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:22]** He says, thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:23]** You freed me from my curse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:24]** Yes, I am free.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:25]** I'm free forever now.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:28]** Where did it go?

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:30]** I can show you the world.

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:33]** And then a magic carpet comes up.

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:36]** We jump on together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:37]** Oh, here it goes.

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:38]** All right.

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:47]** So I make a melee attack against your EAC, and if I'm touching enemy tech, I get plus two to that.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:53]** So he reaches forward and grabs the end of your gun, and I get a plus two to my regular attack.

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:54]** Let's see.

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:57]** Just by touching the gun?

**[00:33:57 - 00:34:00]** Just by touching your gun.


## Speaker_0

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:00]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:10]** Uh, so plus two for touching the 18 on the die for 24 to hit your key AC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:12]** Oh dude, it's a shame, man.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:14]** You're so close.

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:15]** You definitely hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:17]** Yeah, I definitely hit.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:22]** So he grabs into your gun and this electric surge jolts through your body.

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:29]** for a total of 4d6 of electrical damage.

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:31]** Holy... Whoa.

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:33]** What?

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:36]** D***.

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:37]** 2 plus 6.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:39]** Plus one.

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:41]** Plus one.

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:47]** So two plus six plus one plus one is a total of ten points of damage.

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:47]** Is that right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:48]** Dang.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:51]** And I already used my reaction this turn already, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:52]** Yeah.

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:56]** I'm not sure you could dodge a Jolton Surge, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:02]** Well, it doesn't matter because I can't do it, but if I could, then I would.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:03]** I can't make, I don't know, electrical.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:08]** We'll find some cool something.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:09]** Damn, that sucks.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:10]** Yeah.

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:10]** Can you just not?

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:12]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:14]** I think that's awesome.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:17]** Now, let me take away my spell slot for you so I don't go doing that twice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:19]** This is the opposite of living a happy life together.

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:23]** Getting 10 points of electric damage.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:32]** He's just like... Thaddeus is just like... Watching that happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:35]** He's rubbing his hands together.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:35]** He's shaking.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:39]** Yeah, get him!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:45]** Well, it is in fact Rolu's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:46]** No way.

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:47]** Wow.

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:51]** If only that happened right after that, I could have used that.

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:52]** Dang it.

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:54]** Okay.

**[00:35:56 - 00:36:10]** I think Rolu is going to pull an Arya Stark, and he is going to swing up with his tactical spear, and I'm going to do a full attack on this mofo.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:17]** And I'm going to use my Raven and Real Die, hoping that it makes my dreams come true.

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:20]** Whoa, I just saw that Akeshdi move five feet away.

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:23]** Yeah, trying to get this turd where it belongs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:26]** You said it was Akeshdi number two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:29]** So just for the listener, we threw a turd.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:32]** It's a beautiful turd.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:33]** Steaming and everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:35]** With stick lines and everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:36]** Didn't take long.

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:38]** Didn't take long.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:47]** All right, first attack swinging up as Rolu is out of breath, frantically trying to get this asshole out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:49]** It's not nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:50]** Out of the box.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:55]** It's a critical failure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:56]** Yes!

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:58]** Wow.

**[00:36:58 - 00:37:00]** First attack is a critical failure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:03]** So wait, do you roll your own critical fumbles?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:07]** I'll tell you when to stop.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:08]** I'm going to leave it up to Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:09]** Kev will tell you when to stop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:10]** I thought we were using cards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:13]** Yeah, but I'm saying I'm going to leave it up to Kev if I...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:15]** Yeah, I'm not going to let you pick your own card.

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:15]** That's cheating.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:16]** What?

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:17]** No, not pick my own card.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:18]** That's cheating, Kev.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:20]** That's the line.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:22]** Yeah, he's going to be like, I want this card.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:25]** That's the arbitrary designation for cheating.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:27]** Oh, you get teleported to a magical land.

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:29]** That sounds like a terrible failure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:30]** Okay.

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:31]** Here we go.

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:36]** Let me do a quick little shoo-ful.

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:39]** As professionals say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:40]** A souffle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:42]** Don't bother me.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:44]** There's so many rolls cards here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:46]** The staff spontaneously combusts.

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:47]** Roll a d4.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:49]** Yeah.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:50]** Immediately die.

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:51]** Here we go.

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:51]** Three.

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:53]** Get it in focus.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:54]** Three, two, one.

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:58]** Stop.

**[00:37:58 - 00:38:00]** Pulling the card at the top of the cut.

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:04]** Wait.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:05]** Oh, no.

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:06]** Yes.

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:07]** Yes.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:14]** Well, I'm going to... So, on these cards, again, as we talked about before... Yeah?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:16]** Kev just made the, like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:35]** emperor lightning fingers as he said yes palpatine oh kevin's palpatine kevin is palpatine i bring a vote of no confidence uh so there are three choices on the critical fumble

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:36]** Or not choices, there are three.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:39]** There's energy, kinetic, and spell, and whatever type of attack yours was.

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:40]** It falls through.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:46]** There's also an extreme, and if the extreme lines up with your attack, you have the option of doing it.

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:50]** And I'm just going to say right now, Kev, am I doing the regular or am I doing the extreme?

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:52]** Because it does line up with melee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:53]** You just said if it lines up.

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:54]** What's the rule of the card?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:55]** You don't have to.

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:58]** The rules say you don't have to, but that's like it's on there to up the stakes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:58 - 00:39:00]** I'm going to leave this to a vote.

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:01]** Okay, everybody raise your hands.

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:02]** A vote or a die vote.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:04]** I'm guessing extreme is bad, right?

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:06]** And regular is less bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:07]** Yeah, but this is a precedence.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:11]** So if you choose to vote no on extreme, we'll never use extreme.

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:17]** I vote yes towards extreme.

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:20]** Wait, does Zoom automatically raise my hand if it sees me raising my hand?

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:21]** That's creepy, Zoom.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:21]** Stop it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:23]** You really?

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:24]** Okay.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:26]** It looks like that passes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:28]** Almost unanimous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:32]** Look, we are playing a game for people, and you know what?

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:33]** It's fun times.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:38]** Kevin, just keep in mind that canonically Roloo has to live through this campaign.

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:41]** Dude, I vote that he doesn't.

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:42]** No.

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:44]** We'll work it out.

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:45]** Don't worry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:48]** It turns out it wasn't Roloo in episode zero.

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:51]** Extreme Melee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:53]** It is a ranged weapon now.

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:56]** That's the name of the thing.

**[00:39:56 - 00:40:03]** Your weapon flies 3D6 squares towards the nearest foe not adjacent to you.

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:04]** Oh.

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:09]** If your weapon reaches the opponent, you deal your unarmed damage to that foe.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:10]** Nice.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:11]** Oh, nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:11]** Wait, this is great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:16]** I will tell you entirely, I did not read that.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:17]** Sorry, Kev, I cut you off.

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:19]** I did not read that before I voted.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:20]** I voted because I think it's better.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:21]** Yeah.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:23]** Yeah.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:24]** Wow.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:25]** What did you say, Kev?

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:26]** I don't know.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:27]** It doesn't sound that terrible at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:28]** Yeah.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:29]** Roll 3d6.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:31]** See if number two survives.

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:34]** Or if he's in a pile of shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:36]** Towards the nearest foe not adjacent to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:38]** The question is... Well, there's only two foes, technically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:38]** What direction?

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:40]** I feel like this is a... You can throw it at Thaddeus.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:42]** It only goes to... There's only one other foe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:44]** There's a nearest foe, so it's got to be at someone's... No.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:47]** Thaddeus is... You guys clearly aren't friends.

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:48]** That's all I'm saying.

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:49]** We're not foes, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:50]** Not yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:50]** Well...

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:52]** That's because it's the other Kesti.

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:54]** I was going to live my life with number one, but number two.

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:59]** That's a total of eight squares.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:02]** Yeah, that totally reaches.

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:03]** Yeah, it's going to get him.

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:03]** That does it.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:04]** That hits.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:05]** That does it.

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:06]** It flies towards him.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:08]** But you lose your weapon now, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:17]** So you go to stab at him, and then he dodges, but it slips out of your hands and just keeps flying straight because it's basically a javelin at this point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:22]** The other Akeshi sees the first move out of the way, and its eyes bulge right out of its head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:25]** Straight out of the cartoon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:28]** So what's your unarmed damage?

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:30]** So here's the problem.

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:33]** Hero Lab is telling me that my unarmed damage is 1d3 minus 5.

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:35]** So, zero.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:36]** Budgeting.

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:37]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:39]** How is it... You get minus damage.

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:42]** Isn't the... Don't you...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:47]** The card said unarmed, but you're saying you're unarmed.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:49]** You got to take a look at that on your own.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:52]** You sure you don't have a condition applied that you shouldn't have right now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:52 - 00:42:00]** Unarmed strikes deal non-lethal damage, and the damage from an unarmed strike is considered weapon damage for the purposes of effects that give you a bonus to weapon damage rolls.

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:02]** Yeah, your unarmed strike is archaic.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:07]** It deals five fewer damage unless the target is wearing no armor or archaic armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:30]** right but isn't isn't the minimum one i would say shirtless technomancer is not wearing any armor that's not true okay i from a i think it's probably minimum one that's my that's my thought but i think there's a total cavalry it's a minimum one but they are in fact wearing armor okay um but so it's one damage


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:32]** One point of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:33]** Hey, that was just enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:37]** Just enough that you guys can question it some more.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:40]** Put a big X and a question mark over that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:42]** Okay, well, that was my first.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:49]** I did a full attack, so I would argue that that's... Yeah, if you crit fail on a first, can you not do the second?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:51]** You can do the second, but you don't have a weapon.

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:53]** You can still do unarmed strike.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:56]** Do like a guarded step back, maybe.

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:59]** Yeah, that's what I'm going to do is the guarded step back so I don't get touched again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:04]** But you declared you're doing a full round action, so do you still have to do full round text?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:05]** This is your call.

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:07]** If I lose my weapon... I don't have the book open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:08]** I have a million things to look at.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:08]** No, no, no.

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:10]** I'm saying this is your call.

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:10]** We can ask the Royals lawyers.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:11]** We can ask them.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:13]** Let's think about this practically.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:22]** If I've got a staff and I'm planning to hit dude twice with it when I swing the first time and I lose it, I'm probably going to pivot in my mind.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:24]** Yes, that's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:36]** Assuming it's a sequential order of events and you haven't already started swinging with your second...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:42]** And I think I'm in the same boat that if you do one attack, you can technically do a second attack.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:45]** Almost like treat your move as a second attack.

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:47]** But you're supposed to declare a full round action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:50]** I think I'm just going to take a guarded step back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:51]** That's fair.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:52]** You do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:58]** I think that makes the most sense because I don't think I have anything else right now.

**[00:43:58 - 00:43:58]** Cool.

**[00:43:58 - 00:43:58]** Okay.

**[00:43:59 - 00:43:59]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:02]** Now it's Chuck's turn.

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:03]** Chuck.

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:05]** Chuck.

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:05]** Chuck.

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:08]** Chuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:15]** Seeing a Kesti numero uno deep frying my homie G over there.

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:19]** I'm going to take a guarded step this way.

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:23]** Is a guarded step a free action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:25]** No, it's a move action.

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:33]** But you don't need to do a guarded step in that instance because you're walking into a threatened square.

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:35]** Yeah, it's whenever you're leaving a threatened square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:37]** I don't know that I want to use my move action.

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:38]** Hang on.

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:39]** Do I have clear light of sight?

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:41]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:43]** What?

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:44]** Don't say what.

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:46]** Will argued that I didn't have it earlier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:47]** I didn't argue.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:48]** You just accepted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:49]** Yes, you did.

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:51]** You were like, oh, that's not a clear line, so I moved an extra two squares.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:54]** I wanted you guys bunched up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:55]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:56]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:03]** Gains of plus two, bonus to AC against the next attack from the creature.

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:07]** I'm trying to remember...

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:10]** So harrying is a plus two on the attack.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:13]** Covering is plus two to AC.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:13]** Cool.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:22]** I want to try to perform covering fire against a Keshti number two, who I should have clear line of sight of.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:23]** Yes.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:24]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:26]** I want covering fire.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:29]** I want to try to shoot at him with my light fastball.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:33]** Do you have to declare it's just whoever that person attacks next?

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:36]** It's whoever that person attacks next, yeah.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:36]** Okay.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:38]** Let me see.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:41]** Provides covering fire for an ally.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:43]** Ranged attack against 15.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:44]** The selected ally.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:45]** You have to select an ally.

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:51]** The selected ally gains a plus two against the next attack.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:54]** So long as the attack occurs before your next turn.

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:55]** That's weird.

**[00:45:57 - 00:46:02]** I mean, I'm going to choose Rolu because he's the only other one within line of sight.

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:05]** Let's see here.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:07]** DC-15 attack.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:10]** Survey says...

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:12]** Nice.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:14]** I got 16.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:15]** Nice.

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:20]** So Roloo gets a plus two AC against Akeshi number two.

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:22]** And then I'm going to yell at him.

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:24]** Hey, try shooting at my friend over there.

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:28]** To use not in the face also against Akeshi number two.

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:29]** Make a well safe, please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:33]** Can not in the face be directed at someone else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:39]** Not in the face is directed at an enemy, but it affects me.

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:45]** So it's a minus four to attacks against me from that.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:45]** Okay.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:46]** From the designated enemy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:49]** Enemy.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:50]** That is pretty cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:52]** It's a pretty cool thing.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:54]** Balls.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:55]** Ties go to the roll.


## Speaker_0

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:56]** Balls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:58]** That was going to be dope.

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:02]** He was going to have minus four to me, minus two to Rolu, and have really crappy options.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:04]** Yeah.

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:07]** I have plus two, but you're unfortunately in the open.

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:07]** I am.

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:09]** Okay.

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:10]** This is the making of a horror movie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:16]** Does that horror movie start with two tiny lizards being surrounded by people with weapons?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:21]** They're not the main characters of this game.

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:23]** You sympathize so much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:25]** They're not.

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:26]** And they're incredibly devastating.

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:27]** Well, it's hard to sympathize.

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:28]** Never miss attacks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:32]** It's really hard to sympathize with Thaddeus, who talks about collecting.

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:35]** He's probably jealous that these guys are tearing apart a carcass.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:38]** But it's Thaddeus' turn, so let's find out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:40]** Dude, like, K'fax are like nothing.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:44]** He does want a piece of these, though, I'm not going to lie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:48]** Thaddeus, I got something for you if you want to delay.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:50]** Oh, what's that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:54]** I mean, I'm assuming I talk to him in a free action, right?

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:56]** Let him know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:58 - 00:48:01]** I was thinking about casting adamantine shot.

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:04]** What does that do?

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:06]** I'm not a magical wizard waso.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:13]** It gives you 2d8 to your next attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:21]** Ronu, I was about to save your ass again, but I'm going to have to wait one more round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:22]** Sorry.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:28]** So you just delay until after my... Because I think I was top of the round, so yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:29]** Yeah, sure, sure.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:29]** My goodness.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:34]** Torme talks about damage in some weird terms.

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:34]** Yes.

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:36]** You delay to the next round, I don't think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:37]** Not round, I'm sorry.

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:38]** Sorry, clarifying, Rolu.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:43]** I'm just going to wait until after Torme because he has some special magical shit.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:44]** But that's what I'm saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:46]** So long-winded Thaddeus.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:47]** Shut up, Rolu.

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:48]** Shut the fuck up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:48]** Just stay alive.

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:49]** You know what?

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:51]** It's fine.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:53]** I can... No, just do it.

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:54]** No, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:58]** Thaddeus is second from the bottom of this round, so you would just be put to the bottom of the round.

**[00:48:59 - 00:48:59]** You wouldn't be able to do it at all.

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:00]** No, I understand.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:01]** I got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:01]** I made a mistake.

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:02]** I know.

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:07]** Thaddeus understands, and he's going to wait for TremÃ©.

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:08]** Is that what you're saying, TremÃ©?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:09]** No, I don't think you should.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:14]** I think you should just fire, and then you can...

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:16]** I'm sorry.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:18]** I have to apologize to Rolo.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:22]** We should just cut all this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:24]** Actually, Rolo, I had a change of heart.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:28]** Because I'm such a big-hearted kitty-catty, I'm going to help you, alright?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:30]** And then he's going to do full action.

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:34]** He's just going to try to forget what just happened.

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:37]** And then I'm going to do... Here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:42]** Did he just call himself a big-hearted kitty-catty?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:43]** Kitty-catty?

**[00:49:44 - 00:50:05]** kitty catty it's uh it's uh he's comfortable in his masculinity all right so it's a 19 is the first one and then the second one is wait who who are you targeting oh the one direct the one near um okay so the argument here is there's cover right

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:35]** there has never been cover in any direction past all this shit before there's all of a sudden cover now we've been firing it like everyone I thought it was only this piece right here that was the the arms are arcing this arm was the one that had I thought this was low cover if anything everything where the poop is at you can walk under but this okay so this thing that looks like a mechanical dinosaur face like screaming that's like all like cover is what you're saying right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:36]** It's partial cover.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:38]** It's probably five feet deep.

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:42]** Again, I'd have to look up partial cover rules.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:43]** That's fine.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:48]** Also, don't forget that these are small creatures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:56]** Thaddeus is just going to do, because he can't take a full action now, but it was basically a 23 to hit, and then he got five damage.

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:58]** I'm assuming you get five damage, Kevin.

**[00:50:58 - 00:50:59]** Sorry.

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:00]** Sorry, not sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:03]** 23 to hit, definitely hits.

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:05]** And I'll take that five damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:06]** Yeah, in the face.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:10]** Is this guy still really standing at this point?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:12]** This is a catch team number one.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:13]** Yeah.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:14]** Five points of damage.

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:17]** That is the end of Thaddeus' turn.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:18]** Nice.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:23]** It is now catch team number two's turn.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:24]** Question, Chuck.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:28]** Your LaFan device is metallic?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:28]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:30]** It is organic?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:31]** I mean, yeah.

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:37]** It's how the flowers relate to each other, not necessarily a physical device.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:42]** Well, given that, Akash T, number two, is going to step forward.

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:46]** And, uh, do I need to be in the same square as you in order to attack you?

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:48]** Cause you're a tiny creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:49]** I think that's within five feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:50]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:53]** Um, he's going to Baxter punt check.

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:53]** Is that what we're doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:54 - 00:52:02]** Uh, he's going to try a jolting shock, but since he doesn't recognize any technology on you directly, unless do you have your rifle out and it's a laser weapon?

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:03]** Cause that would be helpful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:06]** Uh, I'm holding my light fast fault blaster.

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:09]** So is that an EAC?

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:10]** Is that, or is it kinetic?

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:10]** Okay.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:14]** I believe that is kinetic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:16]** Yeah, I'm not going to count it then.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:19]** So that's five on the dice for a total of nine, and nine doesn't hit.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:21]** Nine does not hit.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:25]** All right, so it catches you number two, steps forward, and you see the shocking hand as he reaches for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:31]** Okay, well, this is weird, because I don't want to have to retcon this.

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:35]** It's a force weapon, and it deals kinetic damage, but targets EAC.


## Speaker_0

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:37]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:39]** I mean, it's just a plus two.

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:40]** Does an 11 hit you?

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:40]** I don't think it does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:42]** 11 does not hit, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:43]** Yeah, so either way it misses.

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:48]** So he reaches forward, clenches his fist, trying to grab at your vines, but you're just moving around too quickly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:49]** Kick it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:51 - 00:53:20]** and so he just shocks like you just hear this crackling as his fist closes kind of over your head and that's the end of round number what is this two three and we're back to the top of the round it is Vahri 13's turn Vahri's gonna do nothing Vahri's gonna get brave and try to shoot pulls their gun out

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:21]** I'll count that as a roll.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:22]** It's a terrible roll anyways.

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:26]** It was a four plus four, I think.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:28]** Nope, plus one.

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:32]** So for a five, they completely miss.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:33]** But at least they tried.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:36]** It is now Termay's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:39]** Hey there, Thaddeus.

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:41]** Next time, hit him with a bit of this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:53]** And Tremaden's going to lift one of his arms up and cast adamantine shot on Thaddeus' long arm.

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:58]** Because it only works on long arm weapons, from what I understand.

**[00:53:58 - 00:54:01]** Which I think you're either one.

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:05]** I mean, I guess I have to pick whatever one he has equipped right now, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:08]** Yeah, I got the long arm of the formium venom caster, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:10]** Dope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:11]** That's a long arm, I believe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:13]** So let me just read it real quick.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:25]** Dwarves created adamantine shot to turn common ammunition into deadly projectiles with siege and mining potential, obviously.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:26]** Nice.

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:37]** You transmute one long-arm round or similar missile, such as an arrow, into a magical projectile that performs as adamantine alloy ammunition.

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:39]** Then you launch it.

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:41]** The round splits into three.

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:44]** You can attempt...

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:47]** an attack against the target's KAC for each projectile.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:49]** So you get multiple rolls.

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:56]** And on a success, a shot deals piercing damage based on the slot you used to cast the spell.

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:59]** So I'll read that part in a second.

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:01]** And has a knockdown critical hit effect.

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:12]** Each shot also has the breach weapon special property, but you can use your key ability score in place of strength and add triple the spell line, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:16]** So you get 2d8 piercing damage, I believe.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:16]** Dang.

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:18]** In addition to the other damage, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:20]** I believe so, but I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:21]** You're casting it at second level?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:21]** Yes.

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:28]** I mean, like, the convention in Starfinder is that it's usually an additional thing, because it's just kind of like a supercharged weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:31]** It does say that it transmutes it, but I don't know.

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:33]** What is the... I don't know.

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:35]** Is it worth it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:35]** What is your question?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:37]** Sounds like it, right?

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:38]** I mean...

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:41]** I mean, it's a little extra.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:44]** We don't have to die instantly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:48]** Plus it's one shot, you get multiple attack rolls.

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:59]** So you could do a regular, like you could do a full attack in theory with one shot with the adamantine and one shot with your regular.

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:01]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:04]** But anyways, I cast that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:08]** The way I read it is you transmute it into adamantine.

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:08]** Yes.

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:10]** That's how I read it too.

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:11]** Then it splits.

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:16]** So the round splits into three and you can attempt an attack for each projectile.

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:18]** And each projectile has a 2d8.

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:21]** That sounds absolutely ridiculous.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:22]** That's awesome.

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:24]** It's a dope spell.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:26]** Dope spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:28]** So is that in addition to my regular damage then?

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:29]** No, I don't think so.

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:29]** No.

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:30]** Okay, so 2d8.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:32]** It takes the place off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:32]** Got it.

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:33]** Okay.

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:42]** All right, so he's going to... So I'm going to cast that, and then I'm going to move up to flank the numero two.

**[00:56:44 - 00:57:14]** looks interesting thank you sorry you're flanking who now okay so what John sorry this is me not knowing can you cast a second level spell if you're at second level you can right I believe so well it depends I'd have to look at actually I'm only casting at one so it's let's just do one then 1d8 okay

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:23]** But you still get up to three, so that's three potential chances out of one DA.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:28]** Does a 15 hit your KAC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:32]** What are you talking about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:39]** Because you just marched right past an enemy, so you definitely traveled through and left threatened square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:41]** I see what you're saying.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:42]** Yes.

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:42]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:52]** If 15 does hit, then you will take 1d4 damage because as you walked by, he slashed at you with his survival knife.

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:54]** That's five points of damage.

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:55]** Oh, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:56]** Damn.

**[00:57:56 - 00:57:59]** Do you have to stop at whatever?

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:00]** Where would that AOL have?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:03]** Yeah, that's what I don't get.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:05]** It probably would have been here.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:07]** I don't think you get.

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:08]** You don't have to stop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:10]** Yeah, so like... Really?

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:11]** Okay, cool.

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:12]** You just get hit and keep moving.

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:14]** How come... Okay.

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:16]** So you're saying like, what about each of these?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:20]** No, you only get... Because I only have one reaction.

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:21]** Got it.

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:22]** So I can't hit a second time.

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:23]** Got it.

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:25]** So yeah, as you walk by, he slashes at you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:26]** So what if I went around?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:29]** I mean, I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:30]** Do you have enough... Range?

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:31]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:32]** Movement to do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:36]** I mean, I wouldn't have like... I don't think there is an around...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:40]** Yeah, you can get to one square over from where you were.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:42]** I mean, honestly, you moved your token already.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:44]** Right, but we didn't do the path.

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:47]** Anyways, that's fine.

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:50]** I already applied the damage, so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:51]** Yeah, you took the damage.

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:52]** Cool.

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:53]** Oh, right.

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:55]** So that was Treme's turn.

**[00:58:57 - 00:58:57]** Right?

**[00:58:58 - 00:58:58]** Yeah.

**[00:58:58 - 00:59:01]** It is now Akeshji number one's turn.

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:10]** And a catch-tee number one is going to move up.

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:12]** Oh, shoot.

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:13]** No.

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:16]** Man, what is the rules on tumbling?

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:18]** I didn't look this up.

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:18]** I should have.

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:21]** What's the rules on what?

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:23]** He's just going to make a run for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:27]** Can he run through the thing that you said was cover?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:29]** I believe you can tumble, right?

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:30]** Is that...

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:31]** Not a thing?

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:34]** Tumbling is a move action, and you move at half your speed.

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:40]** The DC to move through an opponent's threatened area is a 15 plus one half plus the CR.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:43]** Yeah, I don't think you can tumble, though, because there's no threatened area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:46]** Oh, because you're unarmed?

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:47]** You don't have advanced?

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:48]** No, you'd be able to threaten me, right?

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:49]** No, you're not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:51]** He's just going to run for it.

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:53]** Yeah, he's just going to move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:54]** Well, he's going to move in.

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:55]** Oh, there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:56]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:56 - 01:00:02]** So make your... Well, you don't have... I don't have a melee weapon out, so I can't make an AOL.

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:05]** Can you do unarmed strikes?

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:07]** Or that's only if you have improved unarmed strikes?

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:09]** It's only if you have improved unarmed strikes.

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:09]** There it is.

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:11]** All right.

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:15]** He runs past you and has enough room to get off screen.

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:16]** I could be wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:18]** Let me hear about it on the Discord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:18]** Yeah.

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:21]** How far away does he get?

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:24]** Can we see him once he leaves the map here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:27]** His speed is, what, 30?

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:31]** So he'd be 40 feet away from you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:32]** If he tumbled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:34]** No, because we just ran.

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:38]** I can't tumble because I don't think that NPCs can tumble technically.

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:40]** No, I think they can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:43]** But if they had an acrobatic skill, probably.

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:47]** But yeah, he's... Jeez.

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:49]** So he runs away.

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:50]** That's what you're saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:51]** Yep.

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:53]** Didn't even bother to look back at a catch team number two.

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:55]** Just sprinted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:58 - 01:01:02]** Well, that sucks because now I just wasted my adamantine shot.

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:03]** Thanks, Kev.

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:05]** Did you though?

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:06]** We'll find out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:09]** Because it's now Rolu's turn.

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:11]** So my rifle has a 100 foot range.

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:12]** Do I have a shot?

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:16]** That's up to you because I can't see past the map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:16 - 01:01:17]** Wow, Rolu.

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:19]** I thought that was a Thaddeus thing, but

**[01:01:20 - 01:01:21]** I'll give it to you.

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:23]** You can go up to 100?

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:23]** Yeah.

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:27]** Or is that a sniper tool?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:01:28 - 01:01:31]** No, the range on my laser is 150.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:31 - 01:01:32]** Go for it.

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:33]** Okay.

**[01:01:34 - 01:01:36]** I'll even give you a plus two for shooting somebody in the back.

**[01:01:37 - 01:01:44]** I just wanted to point out you're shooting somebody in the back as they flee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:48]** Yeah, after they dealt 10 damage to me.

**[01:01:48 - 01:01:52]** And they promised to spend their life to me and take me away on a magic carpet ride.

**[01:01:52 - 01:01:52]** And you know what?

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:54]** It's a crit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:57 - 01:01:57]** Dang.

**[01:01:57 - 01:02:01]** So it sprints past you and you're just like, nope, not today.

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:05]** And you raise your gun slowly and right as it gets to 99 yards...

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:13]** And we don't even know when to pull the cards because it just blows him to pieces.

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:15]** His chest explodes.

**[01:02:16 - 01:02:18]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:20]** My God, Rolu.

**[01:02:20 - 01:02:21]** I didn't expect that from you.

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:24]** Looks like I'm rubbing off on you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:31]** Imagine the camera is the reverse shot where you can like see Rolu looking down the barrel through the hole in the Akeshdi.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:34]** In the Akeshdi.

**[01:02:34 - 01:02:34]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:34 - 01:02:35]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:35]** Quick in the dead.

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:36]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:37 - 01:02:38]** Amazing.

**[01:02:38 - 01:02:39]** Well, that's Ray's turn.

**[01:02:40 - 01:02:41]** It's now Choc's turn.

**[01:02:41 - 01:02:42]** There's still one catch tee left.

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:44]** What do we do?

**[01:02:44 - 01:02:45]** It's flanked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:46]** What do we do?

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:48]** For a climate attack.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:22 - 01:03:22]** All right.

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:24]** The end of Jack's turn.

**[01:03:24 - 01:03:25]** It's now Thaddeus' turn.

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:28]** He's got adamantine rounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:29 - 01:03:36]** Thaddeus just strolls past this out to here.

**[01:03:36 - 01:03:40]** You're standing behind this pile of junk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:41]** I'm still moving.

**[01:03:42 - 01:03:42]** I know.

**[01:03:42 - 01:03:45]** I'm describing it for the listener because you can't just be like, oh, I moved over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:46]** Well, I just did.

**[01:03:47 - 01:04:02]** So now Thaddeus just strolls confidently past this junk and then his gun glowing in one hand and then he just takes both of his hands and fires it up and winks at Torme.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:03 - 01:04:04]** I hope you absolutely miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:38]** i don't think it's gonna make it you get three attack rolls oh i do okay without without taking away the four because it's a standard action that you're shooting but it splits into three okay so so you roll an attack roll for each because the bullet splits into three so you roll one for each bullet or each shard okay yep got it one


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:40 - 01:05:10]** and uh do you want to tell us what you got yeah so it's 20 to hit and why is it oh it's 20 first one's 20 20 correct to hit on the first one um and then i that's it so it's just like so that's like one 2d8 so that goes into him right no no it's only one 1d8 so what did the what was your roll for the other two level they didn't make it i mean like the first one was 10 and then the last one was 13 does the 13 hit


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:11 - 01:05:12]** But thank you for checking.

**[01:05:13 - 01:05:15]** So go ahead and roll your 1d8 of damage.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:13 - 01:06:14]** Okay.

**[01:06:15 - 01:06:18]** Uh, well the, this, a cash D it's analog.

**[01:06:19 - 01:06:21]** It just watched its, its partner run off.

**[01:06:22 - 01:06:28]** Um, and it looks, there is, you know, uh, term a standing right next to him to the South.

**[01:06:28 - 01:06:33]** Uh, then you have Rolu and fatty is kind of closing off his exit that way to the left.

**[01:06:33 - 01:06:34]** Uh,

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:41]** And he turns to look north, and he realizes that this plant, he remembers that the plant is actually also fighting him.

**[01:06:43 - 01:06:44]** So he decides to fight.

**[01:06:45 - 01:06:52]** And he reaches for Tamei with a shocking hand, just like he did to Chak.

**[01:06:53 - 01:06:54]** And he misses.

**[01:06:55 - 01:07:02]** You see his fist close right next to your face, but he's just too frightened and unable to actually make contact.


## Speaker_0

**[01:07:03 - 01:07:03]** That's awful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:04 - 01:07:06]** And that's the end of his turn.

**[01:07:06 - 01:07:06]** Dang.

**[01:07:06 - 01:07:07]** He's also out of spells.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:08 - 01:07:08]** Time's up.

**[01:07:08 - 01:07:10]** Thanks for telling us that, yeah.

**[01:07:10 - 01:07:12]** Time's up.

**[01:07:12 - 01:07:12]** It's your turn, Tomei.


## Speaker_0

**[01:07:13 - 01:07:13]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:07:15 - 01:07:19]** You want to give up now or do you want to just have us end it?

**[01:07:20 - 01:07:22]** I will keep fighting for the on brood.

**[01:07:22 - 01:07:24]** For the on brood.

**[01:07:24 - 01:07:26]** I'm not afraid to you.

**[01:07:27 - 01:07:31]** The on brood is about to get on off brooded.

**[01:07:32 - 01:07:34]** I don't know.

**[01:07:35 - 01:07:36]** On brood.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:36 - 01:07:36]** Nice try.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:07:37 - 01:07:38]** You'll get it next time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:40 - 01:07:41]** But do ask him what that is.

**[01:07:41 - 01:07:42]** What is that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:07:43 - 01:07:47]** Can I do like a culture check real quick to see what the on brewery is?

**[01:07:47 - 01:07:48]** Sorry, can you explain?

**[01:07:49 - 01:07:50]** Yeah, just hold on one sec.

**[01:07:50 - 01:07:52]** I got a...

**[01:07:53 - 01:07:55]** I got a 23 on my culture check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:56 - 01:08:04]** Then you would know that unbrood is a common term given to the group of Akestis that are often outcasted from Akesti society.

**[01:08:06 - 01:08:08]** They're usually the ones that are slated to become riveners.

**[01:08:09 - 01:08:11]** And they are shunned by society.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:08:11 - 01:08:13]** Got it.

**[01:08:14 - 01:08:15]** Okay.

**[01:08:15 - 01:08:17]** I'm just going to hit them with the big club.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:08:20 - 01:08:21]** Oh, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:08:22 - 01:08:23]** I'm going to swing at them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:08:23 - 01:08:43]** he asked for it he asked for it does an 18 hit and 18 hits three points of damage okay roll it's your turn wow i think one of the hands is going to go out and pat thaddeus on the back on the head scratches behind his ear

**[01:08:44 - 01:08:47]** I don't know if Teddy just wants me to touch him behind the ear.

**[01:08:47 - 01:08:48]** No, I don't.

**[01:08:48 - 01:08:49]** Don't touch me.

**[01:08:49 - 01:08:49]** Don't touch me.

**[01:08:50 - 01:08:52]** Roller.

**[01:08:52 - 01:08:54]** I know what it's like.

**[01:08:54 - 01:08:55]** Roller's going to...

**[01:08:56 - 01:09:18]** just reach out after shooting and then just turn his head in the other direction and reach out with one of his hands and trace a door and then almost like a cool the really cool people who blow smoke rings and then push them out with their hands he's going to push the white circle or the white rectangle of smoke and

**[01:09:18 - 01:09:23]** as he casts Death's Door on this Keshti.

**[01:09:23 - 01:09:31]** And you need to make a Fortitude saving throw.


## Speaker_0

**[01:09:31 - 01:09:31]** Ooh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:09:31 - 01:09:32]** Good luck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:33 - 01:09:35]** Natural one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:09:36 - 01:09:38]** Oh, yes.

**[01:09:40 - 01:09:42]** Problem is, I only rolled two points of damage.

**[01:09:44 - 01:09:47]** Also take two points of strength damage.

**[01:09:47 - 01:09:48]** Ooh.

**[01:09:48 - 01:09:49]** Yeah.

**[01:09:49 - 01:09:49]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:50 - 01:09:52]** I'm going to take that out of.

**[01:09:52 - 01:09:53]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:09:53 - 01:09:56]** As this white translucent door passes over you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:58 - 01:09:59]** He's still up.


## Speaker_0

**[01:10:00 - 01:10:00]** How?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:01 - 01:10:04]** Because you guys are doing terrible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:10:04 - 01:10:07]** It's like 14 points of damage to this guy alone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:10:08 - 01:10:09]** Yeah.

**[01:10:09 - 01:10:15]** Chalk is going to open his sleeves in the way you would open a palm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:10:16 - 01:10:20]** He's going to set his blaster down and say, Look, dude, you don't have to die today.

**[01:10:20 - 01:10:24]** We can work this out if you want to chill.

**[01:10:24 - 01:10:26]** Maybe give us some information.

**[01:10:26 - 01:10:27]** We can all go about our business.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:10:27 - 01:10:28]** That's your turn?

**[01:10:28 - 01:10:32]** I would like to make a diplomacy check to de-escalate this.

**[01:10:32 - 01:10:33]** I think it's worth trying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:34 - 01:10:35]** Okay.

**[01:10:35 - 01:10:36]** Go ahead.

**[01:10:36 - 01:10:37]** I'm going to oppose it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:10:39 - 01:10:39]** 24.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:40 - 01:10:41]** All right.

**[01:10:42 - 01:10:42]** We'll see where that goes.

**[01:10:44 - 01:10:47]** It's Thaddeus' turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:10:47 - 01:10:49]** Thaddeus, full action in the face.

**[01:10:50 - 01:10:53]** No, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:53 - 01:10:54]** We don't have to fight.

**[01:10:55 - 01:11:02]** Cretans.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:02 - 01:11:04]** That's a 13 doesn't hit, I'm guessing.

**[01:11:04 - 01:11:06]** What about a, oh, ah, fuck.

**[01:11:06 - 01:11:07]** I don't think either of these are going to hit.

**[01:11:08 - 01:11:13]** So it's like the highest roll is, does a 13 hit?

**[01:11:13 - 01:11:14]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:14 - 01:11:15]** 13 does not hit.

**[01:11:15 - 01:11:16]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:16 - 01:11:17]** Yeah.

**[01:11:18 - 01:11:20]** Thaddeus is really sad right now.

**[01:11:21 - 01:11:23]** We can work this out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:11:23 - 01:11:25]** Yeah.

**[01:11:25 - 01:11:27]** That was a warning shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:27 - 01:11:34]** So the Keshti is going to take a guarded step away from Termay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:11:35 - 01:11:35]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:36 - 01:11:43]** And then he's going to look at Chuck with his hands on, or his leaves and hands up in the air.

**[01:11:45 - 01:11:47]** And he's going to step over him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:47 - 01:11:47]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:11:51 - 01:11:53]** He's just literally walking away.

**[01:11:53 - 01:11:55]** Somebody's got to get an AOL.

**[01:11:55 - 01:11:56]** I don't have a melee weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:56 - 01:11:56]** Who does?

**[01:11:57 - 01:11:58]** Chalk does, right?

**[01:11:58 - 01:12:03]** A guard has stepped away from Termay, and Chalk put all his weapons down and has his hands up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:12:03 - 01:12:05]** Roll to do that laser thing you did again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:06 - 01:12:08]** So let me just double check.

**[01:12:10 - 01:12:13]** 30 feet of range, so that's where I'm at.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:12:14 - 01:12:15]** No, you said...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:12:16 - 01:12:17]** 30 or 40.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:17 - 01:12:19]** How many feet do you get to move?

**[01:12:19 - 01:12:22]** I started here because I did a guarded step away from you.

**[01:12:22 - 01:12:22]** Okay.

**[01:12:23 - 01:12:26]** And I used a... I went kitty corner here.

**[01:12:26 - 01:12:30]** I didn't... Why do you guys question every little thing that I do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:12:30 - 01:12:32]** Because you question every little thing that we do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:32 - 01:12:34]** Because you guys cheat constantly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:12:34 - 01:12:36]** Like going right through Shaq.

**[01:12:36 - 01:12:37]** We cheat constantly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:37 - 01:12:38]** constantly.

**[01:12:38 - 01:12:42]** I'm just going to give you one D8 of damage for three rounds.

**[01:12:42 - 01:12:44]** Anyways, moving on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:12:44 - 01:12:45]** That's a perfectly normal spell.

**[01:12:45 - 01:12:46]** That was a spell.

**[01:12:47 - 01:12:48]** That's how it's written.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:48 - 01:12:50]** Alright.


## Speaker_0

**[01:12:51 - 01:12:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:51 - 01:12:52]** Whose turn is it?

**[01:12:52 - 01:12:53]** Let's move.

**[01:12:53 - 01:12:54]** It's Vahri's turn.

**[01:12:55 - 01:13:01]** They are scared as this Keshi seems like it's coming right for them.

**[01:13:02 - 01:13:06]** So they're going to take full defense and almost cower in their place.

**[01:13:08 - 01:13:09]** It is Termay's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:13:10 - 01:13:12]** Termay seeing this coward run off.

**[01:13:14 - 01:13:15]** Shoots him in the back.

**[01:13:16 - 01:13:17]** Don't let them get away.

**[01:13:17 - 01:13:19]** I got to make sure that I follow all the rules.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:13:19 - 01:13:20]** This Akeshi was pretty smart.

**[01:13:21 - 01:13:27]** For the listener, they really kind of routed us and got right past Jack and went.

**[01:13:28 - 01:13:33]** Got a good gap between Thaddeus and myself and Vari.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:13:34 - 01:13:38]** Treme is going to make chase from the other direction.

**[01:13:38 - 01:13:39]** Nice.

**[01:13:41 - 01:13:42]** And...

**[01:13:43 - 01:13:52]** going to pull out the... So it's a move action to pull out a new weapon if I don't drop the one that's in my hands, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:53 - 01:13:56]** If you don't have a bonus attack.

**[01:13:56 - 01:13:57]** You've got a base attack bonus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:13:57 - 01:14:00]** Since you have two extra hands, you can pull it out for free.

**[01:14:00 - 01:14:01]** Oh, sweet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:14:03 - 01:14:11]** So I'm just going to pull out the good old tactical semi-auto.

**[01:14:11 - 01:14:12]** Tactical semi-auto.

**[01:14:16 - 01:14:17]** Take the shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:14:19 - 01:14:20]** Take the shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:14:20 - 01:14:21]** Shoot her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:14:21 - 01:14:22]** Shoot her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:14:23 - 01:14:23]** For a 15.

**[01:14:23 - 01:14:27]** A 15 does hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:14:27 - 01:14:28]** Yes.

**[01:14:28 - 01:14:30]** Yeah.

**[01:14:30 - 01:14:33]** Just tracking them in your sights.

**[01:14:33 - 01:14:33]** Meow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:14:33 - 01:14:34]** Okay.

**[01:14:34 - 01:14:34]** Okay.

**[01:14:34 - 01:14:36]** Five points of damage.

**[01:14:38 - 01:14:50]** So again, as the second Akesh-T tries to flee from the bullies that invaded their space and attacked them, he is shot in the back of the head.

**[01:14:52 - 01:14:58]** And you just see his lizard body collapse and splay out on the ground as he dies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:14:58 - 01:14:59]** They had it coming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:15:01 - 01:15:19]** did they i mean did they yeah uh it is so i guess we're out of combat right on them yeah are you uh i don't know i'm gonna i'm gonna walk up to the one that has a head if that's possible

**[01:15:20 - 01:15:30]** As this lizard creature slides across the ground and lands at the feet of Vahri 13.

**[01:15:30 - 01:15:30]** Amazing.

**[01:15:31 - 01:15:36]** They kind of have this look of shock on their face after witnessing what you guys all just did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:15:36 - 01:15:37]** No ways to fight Vahri.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:15:41 - 01:15:49]** But all that washes over because Vahri 13, after seeing all that and then looking around to make sure nothing else is going on,

**[01:15:50 - 01:15:55]** They look at you guys, each of you almost, with just pure excitement over their face.

**[01:15:56 - 01:15:59]** You can almost tell it's nothing to do with what they just witnessed.

**[01:15:59 - 01:16:01]** And they go back to staring at their pad.

**[01:16:02 - 01:16:04]** And you can hear this beeping because it's silent now.

**[01:16:05 - 01:16:08]** You hear beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

**[01:16:09 - 01:16:14]** And as Vari starts to step forward, they say, this is it.

**[01:16:15 - 01:16:17]** And they step forward and the beeping gets more constant.

**[01:16:18 - 01:16:20]** And it actually gets to a solid tone.

**[01:16:22 - 01:16:23]** and they turn off their data pad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:16:25 - 01:16:27]** And then they transform into a dragon.

**[01:16:27 - 01:16:29]** And they're right near that engine little thing.

**[01:16:29 - 01:16:31]** Yeah, they pick up the engine and they throw it at us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:33 - 01:16:40]** After looking around with disappointment on their face, that is not the Stellar Flare.

**[01:16:42 - 01:16:45]** From my research, the Stellar Flare is a modified Cavallari Venture.

**[01:16:46 - 01:16:51]** I do not know much more about starships, but I know this is not the Stellar Flare.

**[01:16:52 - 01:16:53]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:16:53 - 01:16:54]** What?

**[01:16:54 - 01:16:59]** So what is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:16:59 - 01:17:02]** What a left turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:17:02 - 01:17:03]** What a left turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:17:03 - 01:17:08]** I really wanted to cast my words on the cashier.

**[01:17:08 - 01:17:09]** He's just going to say, fuck you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:17:09 - 01:17:12]** You had it coming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:17:16 - 01:17:18]** Thanks for listening, you scallywags.

**[01:17:19 - 01:17:25]** Until next week, drift begones at Distant Stars.
