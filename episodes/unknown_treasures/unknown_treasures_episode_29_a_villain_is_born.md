## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:00:01 - 00:00:12]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:13]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:15]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:16]** Get out.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:20]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:22]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:22 - 00:00:30]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales of the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:33]** Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:00:55 - 00:00:56]** Domino's on three.

**[00:00:56 - 00:00:56]** Ready?

**[00:00:56 - 00:00:58]** Three, two, one.

**[00:00:58 - 00:00:59]** Domino's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:00 - 00:01:02]** So we should have said Domino's right at the beginning, right?

**[00:01:03 - 00:01:05]** Because you said on three and then you said three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:01:06 - 00:01:10]** And that is our opener for episode 29.

**[00:01:10 - 00:01:15]** The Christmas special.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:16 - 00:01:17]** The holiday special.

**[00:01:17 - 00:01:18]** I had a whole big plan.

**[00:01:18 - 00:01:20]** I was going to come in and do it like a Santa Claus voice.

**[00:01:20 - 00:01:22]** Oh, do it, do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:23]** Santa Kevin.

**[00:01:23 - 00:01:24]** Yeah, do it, do it.

**[00:01:24 - 00:01:26]** Welcome to... That sounds stupid.

**[00:01:26 - 00:01:28]** That sounds like a Disney voice.

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:29]** It is not as...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:29 - 00:01:40]** We'll save and the interstellar tales from the extra galactic adventure anthology.

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:41]** I'm Santa Claus.

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:43]** Welcome to our show.

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:46]** But all of you are on my naughty list.

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:47]** Oh my God.

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:48]** All right.

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:49]** That sounds terrible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:49]** I hate this.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:51]** What did I do?

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:52]** Why did I get on the naughty list?

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:53]** This is the worst.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:57]** I think Vinny's saying, wait, so we were supposed to say Domino's on three, right?

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:59]** Is a really good cold open.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:02]** That's just a solid cold open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:02]** You know what's cold?

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:03]** We have Domino's.

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:06]** The pizza that we have sitting here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:07]** No, it's really warm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:09]** It's good because Kelly just got it.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:11]** I don't know, Kelly, how is the pizza?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:12]** Oh, it's so delicious.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:14]** I can't wait until an hour from now when you can enjoy it.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:16]** That's right.


## Speaker_0

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:16]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:20]** It's from the beloved hometown establishment of Domino's.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:20]** Yeah.

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:21]** There's only one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:22]** It's like a local legend, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:27]** It's actually, it's our local Domino's, which is better than everyone else's local Domino's.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:27]** Naturally.

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:28]** No, it is.

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:32]** Because, you know, they import the water from Domino's HQ.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:33]** Plus the employees.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:35]** They, like, cry into the dough.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:38]** And it, like, becomes, like, really salty and good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:41]** It's only Domino's if you get the water from Domino's France.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:43]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:46]** Special, like, regulations for that and everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:48]** I'm terrible at geography.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:50]** Is there a Domino's France?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:53]** There's one region where they do everything like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:54]** All they do is make pizza there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:55]** Yeah, that's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:56]** And they export it.

**[00:02:57 - 00:03:01]** Every Domino's pizza you buy is reheated up from Domino's.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:03]** Yeah, it's been flown in frozen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:06]** I mean, you know, people say that's less fresh, but it isn't really.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:08]** If you freeze it like right away and then you ship it, it's like the same.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:12]** Have we alienated enough people on pizza?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:16]** I mean, if you want to get into details, I actually worked in the food freezing industry for a long time.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:18]** Wait, so you really are Santa Claus?

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:18]** My God, Kevin.

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:20]** This is true, by the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:22]** Santa Claus used to freeze things?

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:23]** Yeah.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:24]** He's Mr. Freeze, right?

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:27]** True.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:28]** Naughty list.


## Speaker_0

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:29]** Right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:34]** I know why he went into aeronautics so he could deliver faster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:39]** He's in cahoots with Jack Frost, who is actually the Mr. Freeze guy.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:43]** Jack Frost is the one that freezes everything and Santa delivers it.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:44]** He's like UPS.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:45]** Oh.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:48]** You should write the algorithms for his delivery thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:49]** Does Santa have an app?

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:50]** Is that a thing?

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:50]** Yeah.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:51]** Is there a Santa app?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:52]** I'm sure there is.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:53]** I'm sure there is.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:54]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:55]** My son will tell me about it.

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:57]** Probably.


## Speaker_0

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:57]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:59]** Dada, Santa app.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:01]** Get out of here, kid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:07]** How funny would it be to hack the Santa app and always have coal be given away?

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:12]** No matter what you do.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:13]** No matter how much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:18]** This Santa app sponsored by Kingsford Charcoal.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:18]** Like, what's the deal?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:26]** The thing is, the app that Santa uses to deliver presents and tell them whether or not a kid is naughty or nice.

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:27]** Like, that's the app you're talking about.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:29]** You're not talking about the app that people use to track Santa.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:32]** You're talking about Santa's app to deliver.

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:32]** Yeah.

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:35]** You're hacking into that and making sure everybody gets called.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:36]** Santa Nav.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:38]** Man, the whole world's gone naughty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:39]** Yeah, Santa.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:41]** I mean, it makes doing the rounds a lot easier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:42]** Yeah, it does.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:43]** Just deliver the same thing to everyone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:44]** Shooting some coal down the chimney.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:46]** You could just, yeah, shoot it down.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:47]** Pretty efficient.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:49]** If, you know, you have a chimney.

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:50]** Otherwise, you just got to throw it through the window.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:52]** Yeah, that's it.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:53]** All right, well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:54]** Well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:59]** Welcome back to we'll save in the interstellar.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:00]** I'm Kevin.

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:03]** This is unknown treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:03]** Wow.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:06]** Five minutes of pre intro intro.

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:06]** Yeah.

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:07]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:10]** I'm sure you're all on our, on our good list or whatever it's called.

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:10]** Yeah.

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:11]** Except for you that aren't on the discord.

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:12]** Are you on the naughty list?

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:13]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:17]** Thanks to everyone on the good list on our discord.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:17]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:18]** You know what?

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:20]** If you're on the good list, you know what we're going to do for you this year?

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:22]** We're going to send you dominoes.

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:23]** From Domino's France.

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:24]** From Domino's France.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:25]** Yeah, we're going to have it.

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:27]** We're going to send you Domino's.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:28]** From Domino's France.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:30]** It just comes with a Y. The game Domino's.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:32]** We're going to send you a single Domino piece.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:34]** A single Domino from the game of Domino's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:39]** Yeah, that feels a little bit like a murder mystery, you know, like killer signature piece.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:41]** This sounds like the whole Toyota.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:42]** He left the Domino at the sea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:47]** thing where one year some radio show was going to give away a Toyota.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:49]** He's got double sixes.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:54]** Somebody won it and they were expecting a car, but it got a toy Yoda.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:55]** Oh my God.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:57]** She won.

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:58]** She got a car in the end.

**[00:05:58 - 00:05:59]** Yeah, good.

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:00]** There it is.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:02]** There it is.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:05]** Also, sorry, we're probably not going to send you dominoes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:08]** Right, I was looking at John like, stop, dude, stop.

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:09]** Hey, you know what?

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:11]** Stop what?

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:13]** She's promising things to our listeners.

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:15]** We're going to send you dominoes from dominoes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:17]** John's going to send you nothing.

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:19]** Me, personally, yeah.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:21]** I will personally send it to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:22]** Thanks, John.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:24]** I'm on the Discord, technically, too.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:24]** Yeah, me too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:28]** John, I appreciate you sending me...

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:29]** Domino's.

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:30]** John, I want jalapenos.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:30]** On my travels.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:33]** I want pineapple on my Domino's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:35]** I want pineapple on my pizza.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:37]** If you want pineapple, you're not getting it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:41]** Just so you put pineapple on it.

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:44]** It's a plain cheese Domino's game piece.

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:45]** Yes.

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:47]** Thank you for that, Kev.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:51]** Oh my god.

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:54]** Everything I had planned on top of my head.

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:58]** I'm glad I have notes for the podcast because otherwise I'd be out of luck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:00]** Yeah, that's what happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:00]** I was going to ask.

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:02]** I forget what I was going to ask now.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:05]** If we're on the good or naughty list, I think we kind of covered that one.

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:07]** Merry Christmas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:13]** You asked if we had celebrated any holidays growing up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:16]** I was going to, but I stopped caring about you guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:17]** Yeah, that's fair.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:19]** So you're not going to get Domino's this year.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:24]** So speaking of Kev not caring about us, should we get to it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:25]** Well, you want to start?

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:26]** You just want to go play?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:27]** Yeah, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:28]** Yeah, let's play.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:30]** I'm down for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:33]** What I want for Christmas is to win this combat.

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:34]** Yeah, that'd be nice.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:36]** Yeah, finally, after all this time, I would love to win some combat.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:38]** After all this time?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:39]** Always.

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:39]** All this time.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:42]** Was that a commercial?

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:43]** No, it's a quote.

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:46]** It's only been one episode's combat.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:47]** From Harry Potter.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:50]** Technically, it started in the episode before that, but we didn't even play a full round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:51]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:52]** Yeah.

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:53]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:53]** No, no, no.

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:55]** But I meant that was a reaction to Harry Potter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:56]** To Harry Potter?

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:57]** Yes.

**[00:07:58 - 00:07:58]** All right.

**[00:07:58 - 00:08:00]** Let's actually get started.

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:00]** Nice job, Vinny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:01]** Last time.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:06]** Last time, we jumped right back into a big fight with a big creature.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:12]** A hulking mass of moving junk known as Tinkered Into Some and Murderbot to others.

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:20]** Chalk had discovered the Vesk Zethelred's dead body and realized that his equipment was meant for distractions and agility.

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:27]** Thaddeus retreated, yep, retreated back to Chalk's position and picked up Zephyr Red's Ember Flame Dashko.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:34]** Termay joined them and picked up a glove that lets him use spell gems conveniently.

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:39]** Meanwhile, the murder bot got back to murdering because that's what murder bots do.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:48]** And he crushed the true warrior lieutenant and then smashed the hollow grenade that Chalk tossed and turned out to be a hologram of a giant rivener.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:49]** Um...

**[00:08:49 - 00:09:17]** the last true warrior though stayed in the fight passionate for losing the love interest of it you know his the love of his life that lieutenant oh dude that's right angry and he keeps punching away at this murder bot and doesn't make a single dent i don't think a single piece of damage got through um on the other hand though rolu got a critical hit and was able to take down down some damage and termay was able to use junk restraints to entangle the junk creature uh thaddeus

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:21]** used, uh, out of bad team bullets from Jermay.

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:24]** Got some shots in there too, but now Thaddeus is stepping up.

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:27]** He took a shot on his venom caster, but only one point of damage got through.

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:28]** And I think that's where we ended.

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:29]** Let's get back to it.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:31]** Cause there's a lot of fight left.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:32]** Here we go.

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:33]** In this hunk of junk.

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:33]** That's for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:34]** In this hunk of junk.

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:36]** Wait, wait, wait.

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:43]** Is your cut scene ready to talk about the romance that led up to this for the beast, for like the B narrative that we have going throughout all this for the true warrior?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:46]** I, you think you're ruining it, right?

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:47]** Oh,

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:50]** You guys were going to loot his body like you would loot every other body.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:53]** Both of them had a picture of each other.

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:59]** But thanks for ruining that joke.

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:00]** One other thing before we start.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:03]** I do want to say, we talked about tumbling a little bit.

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:06]** I didn't know enough about it because I never ever use it.

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:06]** Say again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:09]** Kev was so far down in the explanations.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:12]** We'll just cut in with...

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:17]** He had to travel back in time for a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:19]** Sorry, I had to.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:20]** No, you're good.

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:21]** So, Tumbling.

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:23]** Does anybody know how tumbling works?

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:24]** No?

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:24]** Okay.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:25]** It's like moving.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:30]** You move at half your speed if you're going through an enemy's threatened square.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:38]** There's a DC associated, which is 15 plus one and one half times the opponent's CR.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:39]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:44]** You can also go through their enemy's space at 20 plus one and one half times the enemy's CR.

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:48]** This decreases by two if you have to go through multiple.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:49]** So...

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:52]** Or it increases by two if you go through multiple.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:56]** So if you pass through two or three threatened squares, you can just tumble through each of them.

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:59]** But the DC keeps going up because you're more likely to get hit.

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:01]** And you use acrobatics to challenge that.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:03]** Yes, Vinny?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:04]** So you mentioned it goes up by two.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:09]** Is that to say that you make one roll per square and each of those subsequent rolls goes up by two?

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:13]** Or you have one roll for all of the squares and it is the sum total?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:13]** Nope.

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:17]** You have a roll for each threatened square that you try to leave.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:18]** Okay.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:19]** Right, because you're passing through it.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:22]** So if you enter it and then leave it, that would incur an attack of opportunity.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:24]** You're basically tumbling to get out of that attack of opportunity.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:26]** Gotcha.

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:27]** And it's a move action to do so.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:29]** So you're using your move action to move at half your speed.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:30]** The police.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:33]** Just an interesting thing if you guys want to use it.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:36]** And I'm just saying it might come in real helpful against a giant robot.

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:37]** Okay, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:38]** Yeah, you know.

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:39]** All right.

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:40]** Are you giving me a hint?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:41]** Okay.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:42]** I'm not giving anybody hints, man.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:43]** I'm trying to kill you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:49]** I'm still looking at our home screen on Roll20, and I'm hoping to look at this giant monster that we're about to just KO.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:50]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:50]** Yeah.

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:50]** Come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:51]** Let's get to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:53]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:54]** It's reached, John.


## Speaker_0

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:54]** In the air.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:56]** Man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:58]** Let's snap into this Slim Jim, gentlemen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:11:58 - 00:11:59]** Yo, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:00]** Great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:01]** I think we ended on Thaddeus' turn.

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:03]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:04]** It is now Roloo.

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:06]** Wait.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:06]** Roloo.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:07]** I might be looking at the wrong page.

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:08]** I think you are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:08]** Damn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:13]** It is Choc's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:14]** Choc's turn.

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:17]** Choc is threatened.

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:22]** But... Screw it.

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:24]** He's gonna keep blasting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:27]** Shoot.

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:29]** Did I take my attack of opportunity yet this round?

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:37]** But I'm also confused, which means I don't get to take attack opportunities against people who haven't attacked me yet, and you haven't attacked me yet.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:37]** Is that correct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:39]** I haven't hit him.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:40]** Correctamundo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:42]** Well, my memory is short.

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:45]** I'm going to say if you use a ranged weapon within reach, he gets an attack opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:47]** But he's confused.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:49]** Yeah, he's confused, right?

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:52]** Yeah, but you've tried to attack him in the last round, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:52 - 00:13:16]** maybe sure um cool then before i'm just gonna retcon this a little bit before taking his first shot he's gonna yell you smell like dirty motor oil and uses not in the face ability make a make a dc-14 we'll save

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:17]** We'll save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:19]** We'll save!

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:21]** We'll save!

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:25]** Hold on, hold on, that's... The ribbon on the die.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:27]** The we'll save scoops you up.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:27]** There it is.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:28]** Carries you out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:30]** You're going to be just fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:31]** That's a total of 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:33]** Not enough.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:34]** You take a minus four penalty.

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:35]** Three dollars a day.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:39]** All attacks against me until the end of my next turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:41]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:45]** And now I'm going to fire twice because I basically have to crit anyway.

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:45]** Yeah.

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:46]** Fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:47]** Dude, this is a tough fight, dude.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:49]** This is a crit or nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:50]** It's a real tough fight.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:51]** Yeah.

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:53]** I'm going to guess 15 does not hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:55]** Is it energy weapon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:56]** Yeah.

**[00:13:56 - 00:14:00]** So didn't it have some minuses on it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:02]** There are some minuses in play.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:02]** Okay.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:03]** So you said a 15 EAC?

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:06]** 15 EAC, yeah.

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:08]** That is a hit.

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:09]** Hey!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:12]** Let's go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:13]** Let's go.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:15]** How many rounds was he entangled for?

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:16]** Here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:20]** I think it was like 20 rounds, 25 rounds, something like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:21]** If nobody has an answer, I'm going to say two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:23]** No.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:24]** Wait a second.

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:25]** Yeah, two.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:27]** I think it was two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:29]** Okay, so you take a shot and bam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:30]** Boom.

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:34]** And I must catch him in that big glowing eye because that's max damage for an eight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:35]** Yeah.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:36]** Look at that.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:37]** Eight and it's energy?

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:39]** And it's energy, yeah.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:40]** Oh, boy, look.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:44]** Hits him in one eye and the eye actually shatters.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:46]** Oh, nice.

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:47]** Amazing.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:52]** But there's still a glow coming from the eye socket.

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:58]** So his eyes are glowing blue, but it turns out they're almost lenses over the blue glow.

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:00]** That shatters.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:02]** And that's eight points of damage, you said?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:02]** Eight points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:03]** Oh, man.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:09]** Not only is this thing confused, it is now also going to be going in and out of berserk mode.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:09]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:11]** Berserk mode!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:12]** What does that mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:14]** I didn't approve of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:15]** Berserk.

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:17]** That's what it sounds like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:21]** It sounds kind of like the Santa Claus, too.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:23]** Santa Claus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:25]** This is Santa Claus.

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:28]** Ho, ho, ho.

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:29]** So, Chuck, you did two shots, or that was just one?

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:31]** That was the only one that was good?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:32]** That was two shots, only one hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:35]** Nice.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:36]** Oh, beautiful.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:38]** I'm going to move it down.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:41]** It's now the tough True Warrior's turn.

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:45]** And he's actually still in reach of this thing.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:47]** And he's still just angry.

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:48]** He's really mad.

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:49]** And he's going to keep swinging.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:53]** And he's going to do... I'm going to do two hits.

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:54]** Two hits.

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:56]** Two hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:15:57 - 00:15:58]** Two hits, true.

**[00:15:58 - 00:15:59]** Okay, so it's a plus...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:02]** That is a natural 20.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:04]** Yeah.

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:05]** On the first one.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:07]** Yeah, Trudy.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:08]** Oops.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:12]** And a 19 plus four for 23 on the second one.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:13]** So he hits both times.

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:15]** That's crazy.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:17]** That's wild.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:18]** For your guys' sake, I'm glad I put him in this game.

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:19]** Dude, that's awesome.

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:19]** Yeah.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:23]** So the natural 20, that's a crit.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:27]** And that is going to be two D6s plus eight of damage.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:29]** Question on this one.

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:29]** What's up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:31]** For like three after damage reduction?

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:32]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:34]** Yeah, it's like the DR thing is applied to both attacks, right?

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:35]** One and then the other?

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:36]** Yeah.

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:38]** Okay, so let's just do the crit one first.

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:46]** That's going to be five plus three plus eight, we said, right?

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:47]** Because it's plus two times.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:49]** Yeah, so 16.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:49]** Slow down.

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:51]** Okay, yes, 16 minus five is 11.

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:52]** That makes easy math.

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:55]** So 11 points go through.

**[00:16:55 - 00:17:15]** he's mad he's real angry and he hits this thing right in like Achilles ankle is that what it's Archimedes whatever no it's the Achilles tendon tendon yes but there's not tendons on the anyways so how that's 11 points of damage there and then the second one was a hit but it's only it's a regular hit

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:18]** A regular hit.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:18]** For max damage.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:21]** Man, this thing has done more damage than any of you guys combined.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:24]** That tough true warrior is finally making a dent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:26]** Literally making a dent.

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:27]** I love it.

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:27]** Yeah.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:29]** Thank you, true warrior.

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:30]** Thanks, buddy.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:33]** I can't wait to kill you after this combat.

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:35]** No, no, no, no, no.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:40]** We have to make sure that we find somebody to cast to resurrect his long lost love.

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:41]** Oh, right.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:41]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:42]** That's the end of that round.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:44]** We're back up to the top.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:46]** Did you forget that we're pirates?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:50]** Fly away from here.

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:54]** From this dark, cold hotel room.

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:59]** And the endlessness that you feel.

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:00]** All right, Rolu, what are you going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:04]** Rolu is going to...

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:09]** Hear Jack say that joke and say, Jack, we need to work on your set and your material.

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:12]** And then he's going to take a five-foot step back.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:14]** Free five-foot step, just in case.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:16]** A free five-foot step?

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:17]** Yeah.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:18]** Explain that to me.

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:19]** Sorry, it's not a free five-foot step.

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:20]** A guarded step?

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:21]** A guarded step.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:21]** There it is.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:23]** There's no free steps in this game.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:24]** There's no free steps in life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:27]** Yeah, this is not Dungeons & Dragons 3E.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:28]** Yeah, I don't know what you're talking about.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:29]** What game is that?

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:30]** What game are we playing?

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:35]** Yeah, so that is going to be a 13 against EAC.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:37]** It's a definite hit, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:37]** Right.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:38]** Uh-huh.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:40]** So you take that guarded step back, but you tripped a little bit.

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:44]** Right up in the sky.

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:45]** This monster doesn't even notice.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:47]** It scoops off into the sunlight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:49]** Yeah, and then it lands and hits somebody.

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:50]** Is that your whole turn?

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:51]** Yeah, that was my whole turn.

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:52]** That was it.

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:52]** That was all that I could do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:58]** As it goes off into the distance, it glares, and the sunlight kind of lines up with it.

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:00]** It just looks really beautiful.

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:01]** Ah, wow.

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:02]** So it wasn't a waste of a turn.

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:04]** No, there was a moment of beauty.

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:05]** That was really pretty.

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:05]** Yeah, that was great.

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:06]** Thank you.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:06]** I liked it a lot.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:07]** Thank you for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:08]** That's failing forward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:09]** That's great.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:11]** I would think that counts, though, as an attack.

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:26]** and since this golem let's see hold on I gotta read this real quick he's in berserk mode oh yeah that's right he's in berserk mode I have to roll a will save his love for you is like a truck

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:31]** He's not in berserk mode, after all.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:35]** But he's still confused, which means he still targets the last person that shot at him, and you shot at him.

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:37]** And it missed.

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:48]** He didn't notice your beam go above him, but he took a look at you and saw you staring off into the sunlight and realized that you just shot at him.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:49]** And now he's very angry about that.

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:52]** And so he's going to step forward.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:52]** One big step.

**[00:19:53 - 00:20:00]** A refrigerator-sized foot slams down next to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:04]** Rolo tries to keep his balance with this piece, this dais that shakes as he steps down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:08]** I believe there's an attack of opportunity in order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:11]** That is true.

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:14]** Are you saying from The True Warrior?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:15]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:17]** And also from you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:17]** Yeah.

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:19]** Not for me because I don't have a melee weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:20]** Yeah.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:21]** Also, you're in the back part of the square.

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:23]** Good call there.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:25]** He's going to tumble through that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:31]** Kev really doesn't want to nerf his character anymore.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:35]** Kevin really got into Tumblr recently, I noticed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:38]** He super wants to read some Tumblr thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:41]** He was like, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, have you read about tumbling?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:42]** Dude, he did that to me too.

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:43]** He did that to everyone.

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:46]** He's like me in that one episode where I really wanted to tumble.

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:48]** It's the tumble disease.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:50]** When it hits you, you want to tumble.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:51]** I'm going to look at that now.

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:52]** No, don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:54]** You're also going to want to tumble.

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:56]** You're going to tell us how to say it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:59]** Guys, I feel like it's taking over me now.

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:04]** I love the mental image of this 30 foot tall, 20 foot wide.

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:06]** Yeah.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:09]** Just like gymnastics, tumbling.

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:14]** And like when I think of tumbling, because I've got a five year old, it's the like...

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:18]** Oh, he puts his head on the ground and balances himself and steadies.

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:24]** And then he, like, pushes off with his feet, and then his robot hips just, like, smash into the ground.

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:28]** And he gets up and puts his hands up like he did something cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:30]** Kevin, should we explain what tumbling is?

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:31]** What?

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:32]** For those who don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:33]** I think we're good.

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:35]** We talked about it in the beginning of the episode.

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:36]** Did we?

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:36]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:37]** While you were eating pizza.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:38]** So he's attacking me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:39]** Yeah, I wasn't done.

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:41]** I'm going to tell a story now because it's fun.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:49]** Today I was on a phone call for work and I stepped outside and we have a window that you can look into the place from.

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:50]** But my son is too short.

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:51]** He doesn't make an appearance.

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:57]** And my wife was standing there giggling and all of a sudden I see two socks come up.

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:59]** That's all I see is, like, the tip of the socks on the window.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:03]** And my wife's, like, reaching forward, and I was so confused.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:06]** I thought for sure my son was doing a handstand.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:11]** Like, a full handstand, though, because, like, he's not tall enough to, like, just, like, do the head's handstand.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:12]** Like, he would have to be extended.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:15]** And then he steps back, and it's just his socks on his hands.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:17]** He's just like, hi, daddy.


## Speaker_0

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:18]** Hi.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:20]** I just thought that was appropriate.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:24]** Sorry, tumbling makes me tickle.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:26]** So he's going to just smash.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:32]** I rolled for the true warrior as this monster steps away from him.

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:35]** And that true warrior is just like, no, my love.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:36]** And he swings.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:37]** He hits.

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:44]** With a one on the dice and a plus four, he swings, and it's all absorbed.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:47]** So that his last two hits were really powerful, but this one misses.

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:48]** Yeah.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:51]** He makes contact, but, like, the metal just kind of shifts.

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:52]** Get a swing through the ball.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:55]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:55]** All right.

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:58]** You got to go through the ball.

**[00:22:58 - 00:22:58]** The ball.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:22:58 - 00:23:16]** chalk does not get any damage no no any aol rolu is about to die no that'd be cool if i didn't yeah but that's not how this game works what so jack does not get an ao that is how we'll say it works slam mode slam mode seven on the die for 17 to hit

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:19]** Oh, you know what's funny about that 17?

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:21]** Against my wet Casey?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:21]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:22]** Yeah, you know what's funny?

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:23]** He said it definitely hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:24]** It does hit.

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:26]** Yeah, it does hit.

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:26]** Yeah.

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:27]** That's too bad.

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:27]** Yeah.

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:30]** Is that really going to hurt you?

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:31]** You're so squishy.

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:33]** I gotta find the right dice here.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:35]** Squishy and soft.

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:37]** Is that right?

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:38]** Yep, that's the right one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:43]** You can't just roll the dice by putting down, face up, the number you want to see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:44]** It's dark in here, man.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:45]** I can't see my... It's dark in here.

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:46]** Oh, it's dark in here.

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:47]** I found it.

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:49]** It's a little, like the double pyramid one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:50]** It's dark in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:51]** It's got eight sides on it.

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:52]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:53]** That's a one, right?

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:57]** That's a five plus nine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:58]** Plus nine?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:58 - 00:23:59]** Holy cow.

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:06]** 14 points of damage as this giant monster brings both fists down on top of you.

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:07]** No.

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:07]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:09]** Ouch.

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:11]** Wow, I'm into hit points.

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:12]** That's cool.

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:12]** That's great.

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:13]** Yeah.

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:14]** Sweet.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:14]** Oh, boy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:23]** He hits so hard that the rest of that platform, you guys are standing on shakes and chalk and Thaddeus are like, whoa, what's going on here?

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:25]** I mean, they know what's going on there because they're looking at it.

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:27]** But that is the end of his turn.

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:29]** I'm assuming it's a him that's a sexist.

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:30]** Torme, you're up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:43]** Torme, seeing this dude just take a swipe at Rolu is a little afraid.

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:44]** And...

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:55]** He's going to panic, look at this contraption where this fallen dude on this platform to the west of...

**[00:24:56 - 00:25:00]** the platform, I guess there's this, like, blue screen between them.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:06]** Is there, like, some sort of controls or, like, some sort of intimate... Like, is this a trap?

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:09]** This, like, little platform thing, maybe?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:10]** No, and we talked about it, actually.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:13]** I think it was Chuck or somebody else was like, does anything over here work?

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:23]** But no, this platform that you see on the left-hand side that has the aluminum glass, essentially, aluminum-infused shield, it's been there for three centuries, probably.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:25]** So it is degraded and...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:46]** destroyed um so there's nothing active on that console got it all right then i'm gonna uh cast uh adamantine shot yet again onto thaddeus's uh formian venom caster i think

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:48]** Whatever he's got in his hand.

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:51]** Yeah, that.

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:55]** Hold out your hand again for this.

**[00:25:55 - 00:26:05]** And he's going to sort of just make some sort of like a harnessing, you know, chi energy, like an airbending or something like that.

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:05]** That's cool.

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:12]** And some witch word trick sorcery going on will give...

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:33]** adamantine shot for your next shot all right okay so you'll be able to roll three three attacks i love with a d8 that is awesome with d8 damage yeah one d8 all right no wait well i have one d8 anyway yep no no it's it's only one d8 though but it goes through is the thing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:37]** I thought it's 1d8 times 3, because he rolls 3 times.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:38]** Yeah, it's 3 times.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:41]** You basically just roll 3 separate attacks and 3 separate damages?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:42]** Yes.

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:44]** And it all goes through, because it's adamantine.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:45]** Yeah, all the damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:46]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:49]** Yeah, so that's what I'm going to do, and that's going to be my turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:51]** That's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:52]** You still got a move option.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:54]** Yeah, but I'm pretty comfortable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:58]** It's good, because you can constantly buff that.

**[00:26:58 - 00:26:59]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:02]** So, just for the listener...

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:04]** I know we didn't go over it earlier, but this map is laid out.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:11]** There's a rhombus-shaped piece of metal that is about two and a half feet tall.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:16]** It's just enough that gives you a difficulty to move around the edges on even terrain.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:21]** But that takes up the middle of the screen, and then there's that console on the side that we were talking about earlier.

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:44]** thaddeus is up on near that console the rest of the players are on the square and then the last true warrior is just on the other edge off of the square to the right but that's that giant junk monster is dead center and all of that mess this is such a cool map this is a cool fight this is a really cool fight it's a fun fight yeah pretty fun yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:45]** Well, he's a masochist, I guess.

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:47]** It's Thaddeus' turn.

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:48]** Okay, cool.

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:52]** Thaddeus, like, looks down at his dash go and he kind of, like, sweats.

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:54]** And he's like, oh, thank God.

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:57]** Because, like, he has that buff from Treme.

**[00:27:58 - 00:28:00]** He saw what happened to Rolo and he's like, no, thank you.

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:04]** And he's going to take those three shots now.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:07]** Now that he's not using his dash go.

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:09]** He's not in melee range of the creature, right?

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:10]** No.


## Speaker_0

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:10]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:15]** No, so your melee range is changed, but you guys were in his melee range, if that makes any sense.

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:17]** This creature has 10-foot reach.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:19]** I didn't know that at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:19]** Now you do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:20]** Yay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:24]** So he could take a guarded step back and then fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:27]** Oh, because you were taking an attack of opportunity?

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:29]** Yeah, that's true.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:33]** And he is confused, but you have attacked him, so you would be open to an attack of opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:37]** Okay, Kevin, does a 12 EAC hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:38]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:42]** Thaddeus has already fired off two shots.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:43]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:45]** So you fired two shots.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:50]** But before you do that, as you pull the trigger the first time, you are still within range.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:50]** We just talked about it.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:52]** He can interrupt my attack.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:53]** It actually comes before you shoot.

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:54]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:58]** You have to take a guard and step back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:28:58 - 00:28:59]** And that's a metagame.

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:01]** Did he already take his AOL when he attacked me, or was that last round?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:02]** It was last round.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:03]** Got it.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:03]** Got a new round.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:03]** Yeah.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:03]** Got it.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:04]** Right.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:07]** So, no, you shot at him this round, and he took an AOL?

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:29]** yeah or right oh no he didn't take an ao sorry i'm picked up keep no no he took he took an ao against chuck he yeah but i think that was but that was before the robot yeah okay got it yeah so this is the new round so yes he does get his attack of opportunity i rolled a 10 on the dice that's a 20 to hit kac but you're wearing that heavy armor does that hit

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:31]** It just hits.

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:33]** It just hits.

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:33]** It just hits.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:36]** And you're going to die again in this game, aren't you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:40]** But I have my Breakaway Aegis, which I will mention is equipped.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:43]** So that will take some of your damage, which will hopefully be nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:44]** Up to five, right?

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:45]** So it's almost like you have a DR of some sort.

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:48]** That's been nice.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:49]** Four on the dice.

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:49]** Quite nice.

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:51]** For 13 to hit.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:53]** Or 13 points of damage.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:56]** So 13 points of damage, minus five.

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:57]** I can't do math.

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:57]** That's an eight.

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:58]** Eight damage?


## Speaker_0

**[00:29:59 - 00:29:59]** Eight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:59 - 00:29:59]** Ocho.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:00]** Eight damage.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:01]** Minus five is eight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:02]** It's a bold strategy.

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:03]** So I take eight.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:06]** And my breakaway ages dies for the time being.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:08]** So he swings down.

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:09]** You put your arm up.

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:11]** And then he breaks your arm.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:13]** And you can't even take the shot with the Venom caster afterwards.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:15]** Are you sure?

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:15]** For real?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:19]** Man, that's a lot of flavor in that one bite.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:20]** That's a lot of flavor there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:22]** Turn ring of the rules!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:23]** I'm kind of upset.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:26]** That's a lot of flavor in that one, but that's good.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:27]** I like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:28]** All right.

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:29]** So back to your shots.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:29]** You shot two.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:30]** You missed.

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:32]** But do I shoot three times?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:33]** Do I actually get to shoot three times?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:35]** You're shooting one bullet, right?

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:40]** So like your venom caster shoots a needle, but that magic came in and like, I'm just making sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:46]** The single round it gets shot and splits into three adamantine shots.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:47]** So that already happened.

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:51]** Um, it's an 18 to hit and stirred.

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:55]** And, um, this is going to be the damage.

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:56]** How do you know it hits?

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:57]** I'm sure it hits.

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:58]** What did you roll?

**[00:30:58 - 00:30:59]** 18.

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:00]** Does an 18 hit?

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:02]** Because I rolled a 15 earlier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:05]** But this hits KAC, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:08]** No, it's EAC because it's energy bolts.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:09]** No, the automatic team is KAC.

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:10]** It's KAC.

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:11]** Well, whatever.

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:12]** Just 18 KAC.

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:13]** Does that work for you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:15]** It only hits because the entangled...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:17]** Okay, well, you had to add that.

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:18]** I got you.

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:20]** Well, you know, normally you'd be fine, bro.

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:22]** It's only one damage, I'm afraid.

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:25]** But that was the one point that we needed to die.

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:27]** But it does go through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:29]** It hits him in the neck, and you thought it would go through.

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:34]** It definitely breaks some stuff on the way in, but then his skin kind of just absorbs it.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:36]** What a baller.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:39]** Because he's just made of junk, and that bullet is junk with it.

**[00:31:39 - 00:32:05]** so minus one i'm using math because i don't like math so i'm making the computer do it for me all right chuck you're up chuck since we're assuming that this is all happening at the same time looks down at his uh fast fault blaster like oh i didn't know you could do that let's try it again you got it you've got it coming you big hunk of junk


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:14]** re-upping his uh his nut in the face all right and i'm gonna shoot at it let's see

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:23]** That is a 19 to hit.

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:25]** Dang.

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:33]** For... Also, I believe this is your opportunity to take... Did you take an attack of opportunity against Thaddeus?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:34]** I took it on Thaddeus.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:36]** Okay, so... Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:37 - 00:33:01]** four seven man he hit him just next to where he he the he blew his eye glass out last time dang yeah so you jack is just walking this dude down and you're small yeah and this thing is big yeah he's like i mean like you're you're what two feet tall and this thing is 10 feet tall it's gigantic

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:03]** It's got to be bigger than 10 feet tall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:03]** It's amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:04]** It's 10 feet wide.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:05]** It's big.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:06]** It's gigantic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:07]** Yeah, it's a regular David and Goliath story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:08]** Yeah.

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:12]** And you sling your slingshot made of energy.

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:13]** And it goes up.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:16]** And you actually hit him because he wasn't looking at you.

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:19]** He was looking past you at Thaddeus as he just smacked him.

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:19]** Nice.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:22]** And that round goes right up his chin.

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:24]** You see his head tilt back.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:29]** And he looks down at you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:33]** He needs to make a will save for not the face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:34]** I don't think he does.

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:38]** But you're in an adjacent square.

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:48]** So as this junk monster, this gigantic beast, starts to just crumble.

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:53]** I need you to give me a reflex save.

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:54]** Oh!

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:54]** Jack!

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:55]** Just Jack?


## Speaker_0

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:56]** No!

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:56]** No!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:56]** No.

**[00:33:58 - 00:33:59]** Kev, you're a monster.

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:01]** I'm not a monster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:07]** There's a whole, like, intelligence is knowing that Frankenstein's not the monster and wisdom is knowing that he is.

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:09]** Doctor, the Doctor Frankenstein.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:14]** You're saying that the people who are the monsters are the ones that created this guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:15]** No, specifically Frankenstein.

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:20]** Like, everybody thinks that Frankenstein's the monster, but no, like, Doctor Frankenstein.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:22]** You mean Frankenstein's monster.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:25]** Hey, Vinny, what did you get on your reflex?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:26]** I got a 24.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:26]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:27]** Oh.

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:29]** 19 on the die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:31]** It took half of that.

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:33]** Oh, man.

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:35]** That is, what's half of 13?

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:36]** Six.

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:38]** Write it down.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:43]** So, as it starts to collapse, there is a landslide of debris.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:56]** I sort of imagine it's like raining junk, and Jack is just like running back and forth trying to dodge it.

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:58]** He keeps taking shots to the head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:58 - 00:35:06]** Yeah, I think, no, it's even worse than that, because he passed his reflex save, so he like dodged, dodged, dodged, and he made it, and then he's like, and then the last one goes, clunk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:12]** That's incredible.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:12]** Whoa.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:14]** Yep.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:14]** All right.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:15]** Chuck.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:16]** Wait, so is it down?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:17]** It's down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:19]** That is.

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:19]** Did you see that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:23]** I would just want... Good lord.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:24]** I got him.

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:24]** I got him.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:26]** Are you all right, Shaq?

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:28]** Chuck.

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:28]** Oh, boy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:29]** Good job.

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:32]** I think something's awakened in Shaq.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:36]** Evil realization.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:37]** You actually made damage on anything, right?

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:39]** This is the first time you attack.

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:44]** But this monster is just literally a pile of junk now.

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:49]** That is, it was only a 10 foot square, but we're going to say the junk actually is now almost like 20 foot square.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:50]** Gigantic.

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:54]** But that true warrior, you're still in initiative order.

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:57]** Because that true warrior, he didn't stop.

**[00:35:58 - 00:36:01]** He is still just punching at the junk on the ground.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:10]** Yeah, and it's actually his turn.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:14]** He is going to wade further into the debris.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:17]** Here, I'm going to move his buff arm so that it will drew on him.

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:21]** That's a pretty great arm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:22]** I'm going to make him roll for it.

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:22]** He's going to roll for it.

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:24]** Pretty awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:53]** dang so that's a 16 on the dice he definitely just like squares up with this pile of junk and punches down and you just see a piece of metal that was like a part of you know the shoulder or something and he hits it and it just bends around his fist almost just that mad and that's the end of his turn wow it is now Rolu's turn I think you see Rolu stand up


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:36:54 - 00:37:09]** arms kind of shaking from this massive two hit and looks around and just hears the like of the true warrior i'm sure he's grunting and angry right and i i think the first thing that rolu turns around is gonna use diplomacy

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:15]** and just look over and try and change this true warrior's attitude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:19]** So just game-wise, I think diplomacy does require a full minute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:21]** Is that right?

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:24]** Yeah, so he starts now.

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:25]** Spend a minute.

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:27]** So that's ten rounds.

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:28]** So what can I say?

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:29]** Six seconds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:31]** We're just going to let this guy punch the dirt for ten rounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:34]** We'll just leave slowly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:36]** Hey, hey, hey, hey, chill.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:38]** I think, yeah, let's just go through real fast.

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:40]** So you're not doing anything for this round?

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:41]** You're going to try to talk to him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:45]** Yeah, I'm going to try and play the, like, what are you mad at?

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:45]** Like, what can we do?

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:46]** Tremay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:53]** Tremay, uh, is seeing, uh, this creature go down, this junk monster.

**[00:37:53 - 00:38:07]** He's gonna be like, wait, well, we're all in one- I'm in one piece, so I'm gonna look around and see who's not in one piece, but then be distracted by this dude who's just punching away, I guess, at, like-

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:11]** I imagine just sort of like flying off camera.

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:13]** And what are you going to do?

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:17]** Just, uh, look at him dumbfounded, I guess, for my position.

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:20]** Is he elevated for me or like, can I see him?

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:20]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:24]** Uh, he, he would be up on, you know, the same level as all the junk at this point.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:25]** So you definitely see him.

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:31]** I just want to make sure I wanted to hear you say whether or not you still have, we're going to go through one more round of, of, of combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:36]** I'm not going to, I'm not going to get in between him and, uh, you know,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:38]** Cool.

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:40]** Thaddeus, what are you going to do in your combat turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:48]** Thaddeus just has his weapon ready in case it goes down, but he's going to try to help Rolu with his diplomacy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:48]** Okay.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:50]** And lastly, Chuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:56]** You see the ecstasy on Chuck's face as he finally sees himself as useful in the battlefield.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:59]** Right, he tastes victory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:05]** I imagine, like, a squirt of, like, motor grease, like, came across your petals.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:06]** Yeah.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:07]** And, like, on your face.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:08]** Just, like, licking slowly.

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:12]** And you were just like, I am reborn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:21]** So shortly thereafter, you see his look become crestfallen as he's like, sure, this is a joyous moment for him.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:25]** This is also a moment of deep sorrow for him, even though he is only the enemy of his enemy.

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:40]** So I think Chuck, displaying a rare bit of emotional intelligence, would move over to the true warrior and put a vine on his back.

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:42]** Just like, let it out, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:48]** All right, and with that, I'm going to take us out of... Let it out, dude!

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:54]** But the true warrior doesn't even really notice you're there, and he's just pounding away.

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:57]** His fists are getting bloody.

**[00:39:57 - 00:40:01]** There are tears just running down his face.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:03]** He's angry and upset.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:13]** And none of you really know why, but I believe you just, you as players know, he, he was loved that Lieutenant loved her and she's gone.

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:15]** And I'm tearing up a little bit.


## Speaker_0

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:16]** Um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:18]** All right, so now what?

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:19]** What do you want to do?

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:21]** Are you guys going to try to talk to him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:24]** I'm going to say... Shouldn't deserve to go like that.

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:26]** What's going on with you?

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:28]** Are you okay?

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:31]** Frollo, like, takes a step forward on a map, trying to wade through the junk.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:33]** Let it out, man.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:34]** Tell us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:37]** I'm going to say he doesn't even respond.

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:39]** He continues to punch away.

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:41]** He's almost gone, mentally.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:43]** Like, he's not...

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:44]** Responsive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:45]** He's in a daze.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:48]** Rollo turns towards Thaddeus.

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:51]** Thaddeus, I don't know what we can do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:53]** So I'll give him a nice hug.

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:54]** Okay.

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:56]** Yeah, everybody hug him.

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:58]** Should we all move around him?

**[00:40:58 - 00:40:58]** Yeah, let's do it.

**[00:40:58 - 00:41:01]** Should we just get in a circle and hug?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:03]** Everyone just in a circle hugs him.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:05]** Thaddeus is in enormous arms.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:10]** We all join in our warm embrace.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:10]** Yeah.

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:15]** I think, I think Chuck would like to take the lead on that diplomacy check to like deescalate the situation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:18]** Roll is going to aid by saying it's not your fault.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:19]** It's not your fault.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:21]** I mean, it did kind of.

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:22]** Such a good movie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:24]** What's that from?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:26]** Goodwill hunting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:30]** This is not your fault.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:32]** I know.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:32]** I know.

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:35]** It's not your fault.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:38]** So Chuck, you're making a diplomacy check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:39 - 00:42:01]** i am okay i will gm is that acceptable is that cool okay yeah um he nods i got 22 uh let me try to help with that and uh i also aid so it's a 25 27 29 plus the hugs factor i think we got this man


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:05]** So you guys are all, you know, each of you, you know, there's a leaf on his shoulder.

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:07]** I think Rolo put his hand down.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:13]** The other two of you are standing over him and he slowly stops like actually punching.

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:18]** And he just, he's on his knees and he's looking at his hands and they're all bloody.

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:21]** And he looks at all of you.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:33]** And he stands up quickly and he just pushes you away because he knows that the reason that you were there or the reason that they were there was not that junk monster.

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:35]** They were there for you.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:42]** The four of you are the reason that he is in that valley forever.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:46]** But he's too weak to fight you.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:48]** And he's too beaten emotionally.

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:51]** And he pushes Treme out of the way.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:54]** And he walks over to the lieutenant on the ground.

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:56]** And he scoops her up.

**[00:42:58 - 00:43:04]** And he looks back at you guys with this look of just hatred and weakness.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:07]** And he walks away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:12]** Well, we all tried, everyone.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:13]** Wait.

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:15]** Shoot him in the back.

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:16]** Wait.

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:19]** You dropped something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:22]** And in his wallet, you find a picture of her.

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:23]** No.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:24]** Thanks, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:27]** I was going to cast Grave Words on her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:29]** Oh, no.

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:32]** 90% very bad.

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:33]** Wait.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:33]** Hold on.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:37]** I was having an affair.

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:41]** I've never loved him.

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:43]** How do I break up with him without hurting him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:47]** What a great villain origin story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:50]** Yeah, it really is.

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:53]** That Troy is going to come back.

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:54]** I guarantee it.

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:55]** I guarantee it.

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:56]** He's going to come back.

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:57]** He is the big bad.

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:59]** He is the big bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:07]** I want to see the timeline where he somehow channels all of that energy into becoming the next iteration of Tinkerton.


## Speaker_0

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:08]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:29]** he starts putting junk on him starts wearing like junk armor yes sooner or later he's just like in a mech warrior suit lots of junk yeah uh i love it he's gonna just build himself power armor made of junk yeah steaming around uh cool rolo


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:35]** Just after seeing this, there's a heaviness that you see across Rulu's eyes.

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:40]** And there's a fatigue as his limbs slowly relax.

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:43]** Relaxed.

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:50]** And I think Rulu just turns and starts to walk, shuffle away from that hit.

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:53]** The fight, I think, felt like it was going in one direction.

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:55]** And then we all...

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:59]** You know, we all started to get hit and the tide started to turn until Jack changed it.

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:18]** And I think Rulu walks over to a few steps to the right and just leans and sits against this big pile of junk and just pulls out his data pad and just starts scrolling through his photos.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:25]** And you see that there are just photos of stars and stars and stars.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:27]** And classic Rolo.

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:30]** And then as he's scrolling, one image comes up.

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:31]** He pauses.

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:33]** It's the Hears poster.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:39]** And there's just a brief hesitation.

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:41]** And then Rolo keeps scrolling.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:42]** Swipe right.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:46]** He swipes right on Hears.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:47]** That's good or bad?

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:49]** I don't know which one's the right one.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:50]** I don't know.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:52]** And I think Rolo's going to take a 10-minute rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:59]** And he also takes out his notepad and draws two suns and a laser beam going towards him.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:03]** He's like, that's the next painting I'm going to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:12]** Tremaine's going to investigate Tinkerton for the apparatus that makes him tick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:12]** Cool.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:14]** Anybody else want to join him on that?

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:20]** Before he does that, Thaddeus is going to take out his datapad, too.

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:23]** And he just, like, he has that image ready.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:30]** And he just, like, turns it around, knowing that Rulu's gone, and just slowly turns it around and gives everyone, because everyone else is around, a serious look.

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:35]** He's like, that was the captain of your cob.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:41]** I want you all to keep a close eye on Rulu.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:45]** If you see anything, you come to me.

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:48]** Savvy?

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:51]** What?

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:53]** I wasn't paying attention.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:55]** All right, to the brig with you when we're back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:58]** And then Thaddeus text messages Roller and says, fuck you, Roller.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:07]** A bunch of devil emojis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:15]** I think with that development, Jack steals away and pulls out his own data pad to reach back out to the captain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:38]** and as you do you just see a miss a missed message it just says like message and you it's it's from the captain and all it reads is status question mark with like four question marks no just one all caps punctuation is there an emoji of some kind

**[00:47:38 - 00:48:06]** i don't know what's worse so it's just question mark single question mark whichever one is or no question mark bad no exclamation points just one question mark and hand hand scribble so it's like typed out and then had the hand you could like draw it and you drew out the question mark no okay that's it as as whatever the meanest thing you can think of like however you just like portray angry if that's five question marks to you or if that's one that's what the message is the most so are we going passive aggressive or aggressive


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:16]** I'm kind of feeling like, you know, like boomer who doesn't know like about text punctuation and just as like status and like dot, dot, dot status, dot, dot, dot.

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:17]** Just like I use dot, dot, dots.

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:19]** And I'm like, I feel like that's a thing here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:26]** I've become like, maybe it's a thing when you get older.

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:27]** I don't know.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:28]** Was it a Navy thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:29]** Anyway, it's a Navy thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:31]** Anyway, Benny, I just think Kev's a boomer.

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:36]** Um, so check pulls out his data passes.

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:37]** Um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:39]** Sorry, Cap, we got tied up.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:43]** There was a three-story junk robot, but it's okay.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:43]** I killed it.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:44]** I killed it.

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:44]** I killed it!

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:49]** Oh, did you see that bit about Gears?

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:54]** That's got Thaddeus' cat paws all up in a bunch.

**[00:48:56 - 00:49:04]** He seems to think there's something connected between him and the Cobb and some sketchy stuff.

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:08]** We've also got a lead on someone Dotrulu was pretty interested in capturing.

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:14]** We're helping them track down some pretty interesting drift-based technology.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:16]** Probably help us in our pirating, too.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:18]** I'll let you know when it seems like we're close.

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:22]** Go straight out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:24]** No questions about it.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:26]** All right.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:31]** So you two probably join in on looking for the part that you're looking for.

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:37]** So you're wading through a massive pile of scrap that once was a junk golem.

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:39]** That's the proper term for it.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:49]** This junk golem was known as Tinkerton, the avatar of Triune to the space goblin trash hunters.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:55]** But to everyone else in the entire universe, this creature is known as the one and the only murder bot.

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:58]** Like there's no other murder bots in existence.

**[00:49:58 - 00:50:01]** It's a rare build, one of a kind, 0001.

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:03]** It's the only one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:06]** Serial number, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:09]** Yeah.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:10]** Roll me perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:13]** Nine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:15]** Thaddeus, you got it?

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:15]** 20.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:16]** 20.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:17]** Oh, all right.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:18]** Lucky you.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:42]** that yes you're the one that spots it uh as you guys are all wading through this this pile of junk um you kind of see the the arm is still kind of there and a part of the shoulder uh is is sticking out and you can actually see the plasma charging circuit uh embedded in the junk region there um so you go over and you can

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:44]** Take some time pulling that out.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:52]** At the same time, you find six bulk of inert electronic equipment.

**[00:50:54 - 00:51:09]** Uh, you also, you found that right next to the, the, the charging circuit, you found actually a piece of a shuttle that was connected to it that had a hatch kind of, and you open that up and, um, you find two Mark two grenades, frag grenades.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:11]** I'll take those.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:13]** If, uh, no one else is using them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:16]** You don't notice them, but he does toss them your way.

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:17]** Yeah.

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:18]** All right.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:19]** How'd you find something over there?

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:20]** It's all things.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:21]** The pins are out though.


## Speaker_0

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:22]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:23]** So magic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:25]** Here's where it gets fun.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:27]** Frag grenades, right?

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:29]** Two Mark II frag grenades.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:30]** Mark II?

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:30]** Nice.

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:36]** As you all are rummaging through the remains of this murder bot.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:37]** Being watched.

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:40]** Oh yeah, you're definitely being watched.

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:42]** The truers were there.

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:43]** The goblins are everywhere.

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:50]** But I'm going to need you all to take off your headphones and leave the room.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:51]** One second.

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:51]** So wait, check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:54]** All of us except, oh, I got it.

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:55]** Okay, hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:59]** Let me just add frags real quick before I go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:34]** You were drawn to the wreckage of the Tinkerton.

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:39]** The moment you saw this beast, you knew it had what you were looking for.

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:42]** But you can't let the others see it.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:48]** You find the head of the crumpled junk golem.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:57]** And in it, you can see a puck with a bright blue glow that could fit in the palm of your hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:07]** There's a beep as Rose's eyes lock on to that glow.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:09]** A quick scan.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:13]** The others don't see him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:14]** They aren't paying attention.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:15]** They haven't seen that glow.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:17]** His feet stop.

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:19]** There's a little dust that kind of comes up.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:28]** And anybody looking might think Rolo just stopped.

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:47]** But maybe if you knew the way that he breathed in, that the anticipation of what he saw and how much energy is now coursing through all of his muscles is nearly overwhelming him.

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:50]** Rolu takes a deep breath.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:53]** You see his chest come up, one of the arms.

**[00:53:54 - 00:54:00]** Goes out to lean against this junk and kind of look down, carefree as best as he can.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:11]** And while one hand reaches towards the puck, two others reach in, grab his pad and his pen together.

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:20]** And he looks up and starts to kind of look around as if he's just leaning, sitting, maybe just getting his balance, trying to find another place to take a breath.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:29]** And the one mischievous hand reaches in and pushes some of the junk.

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:33]** And Rolo kind of tries to account for the sounds.

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:36]** And as the fingers move around the puck,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:45]** There's a sense of satisfaction for Rolo because he knows that they will be pleased.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:54]** And as the other hands start to move through his pad and pull up maps, of course, he was just doing his map thing.

**[00:54:55 - 00:55:08]** That hand with the puck moves to the concealed compartments upgrade of his armor and slides it in to one of the innumerable slots that he has hidden in his cloaks now.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:15]** And then he just, with a almost pleasant grin under his mask,

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:35]** pulls out his data pad to check it and accidentally brings up the wanted poster of here's his grin fades he shuts off the data pad puts it away and then he looks around to make another drawing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:37]** Awesome.

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:41]** What does your compartment give you?

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:43]** Does it give you any kind of bonus?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:44]** Yeah.

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:49]** The upgrade consists of many hidden compartments that are difficult to distinguish from the armor's surface.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:55]** I'm going to do a plus five bonus to sleight of hand checks when hiding items on your body.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:56]** That's very convenient.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:58]** I think there's one more thing before we go.

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:08]** I love the fact that you pull out your pad and start drawing because I think you're probably drawing that scene of your missed shot that went past the golem's head and into the sun's.

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:11]** We joked about you drawing it, but it's actually what you're doing right now.

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:13]** Which makes sense why you're standing with the head.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:15]** Okay, cool.

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:16]** Awesome.

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:16]** Beautiful work.

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:22]** But what I'm going to need you to do is when I invite everybody else back, I'm going to need you to sneak away from here.

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:23]** Roll a high stealth check.

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:24]** When you come back,

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:28]** I'm going to ask for perception, but I want you to give me a sleight of hand check.

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:29]** Got it.

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:30]** On it.

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:31]** Cool.

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:34]** Disappear.

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:37]** Welcome back.

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:41]** Wow.

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:42]** Oh, man, that applause.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:45]** Sorry, that was just for the listeners to hear.

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:49]** But I will give you a chance.

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:54]** I need each of you to give me a perception check.

**[00:56:57 - 00:56:58]** Okay.

**[00:56:58 - 00:56:59]** Natural one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:02]** 20 again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:04]** Tremaine is just like looking at a pile of junk.

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:05]** 23.

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:07]** Very intently.

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:09]** Not looking at his surroundings at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:16]** I got a... Do you like... 23.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:22]** Termadin found the shards of the lens that we blew out, and he's like trying to puzzle them back together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:24]** Yeah.

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:26]** Shiny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:28]** So... What do we see, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:32]** Thaddeus has been watching.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:34]** Roll it.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:36]** Of course.

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:36]** Of course.

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:37]** Of course.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:43]** And you guys have all been kind of lingering around, searching.

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:48]** But Rolu kind of did roam over back towards the monster.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:54]** After you guys are over there, you know, you're sitting down and came back.

**[00:57:57 - 00:58:08]** And Rolu, you see a goblin whip away.

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:10]** and take off into the shadows.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:12]** Hey.

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:13]** Hey.

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:14]** Stop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:17]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:19]** Oh!

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:21]** How friggin' dare you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:25]** Well.


## Speaker_0

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:25]** Oh, oh, oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:43]** Thanks for listening, you scallywags.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:50]** Until next week, drift begones on Distant Stars.
