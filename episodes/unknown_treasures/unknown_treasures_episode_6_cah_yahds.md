## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:00:01 - 00:00:12]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:13]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:15]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:16]** Get out.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:20]** A simple enough plan...

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:22]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:23 - 00:00:30]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales of the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:33]** Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:00:57 - 00:01:02]** Welcome back to We'll Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extra Galactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:01:02 - 00:01:07]** I am your GM, Kevin, for Unknown Treasures.

**[00:01:08 - 00:01:10]** Untold Treasures, as it says in Roll20.

**[00:01:10 - 00:01:13]** No, don't release my secrets, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:13 - 00:01:16]** Eventual Treasures, because we're going to get a treasure at the end.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:16 - 00:01:17]** Kevin's bad with words.

**[00:01:17 - 00:01:18]** We've established this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:18 - 00:01:19]** But he's not going to tell us what it is.

**[00:01:20 - 00:01:24]** Is the treasure at the end that you have a soliloquy that you perform for us, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:24 - 00:01:26]** I don't even know what a soliloquy is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:26 - 00:01:27]** Like slam poetry or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:30]** Is it a mime soliloquy?

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:30]** Is that why it's untold?

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:34]** Oh, that's so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:37]** I think the treasures were the friendships that we've been along the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:40]** No, we've already established it's not that.

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:42]** Because it's been spoiled and I have to change the ending now.

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:45]** I think the treasures are the credits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:45]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:47]** Oh, my God.

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:52]** Everyone rule out every terrible trope that way that Kevin can't use it for the treasure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:53]** Just keep going.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:53]** I just have to keep reading.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:56]** Kevin, I want, like, some cool stuff.

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:58]** Are we going to get to the end and Riddle's the real villain?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:59 - 00:01:59]** Yes.

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:04]** I want to get to the end and then a pack of dogs run over the hill.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:05]** She's a Yosuke and a giant robot.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:11]** She's just like, crush everything.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:13]** So for my topic this week, I don't have a topic.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:16]** And that's because I'm traveling currently.

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:22]** And so the fun secret for the listener, I am working in a different state.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:25]** And so I'm actually recording this from a hotel room.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:28]** I brought all my recording equipment with me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:31]** It's W-F-A-H, work from hotel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:33]** Kev, what time is the breakfast in your hotel?

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:35]** There's not even breakfast, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:37]** What?

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:39]** How many stars is your hotel?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:44]** The customers that we're going to are actually serving Panera Bread bagels and stuff, but I don't even like bagels.

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:49]** So the point of my story here is... Wait, wait, wait.

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:50]** You don't like bagels?

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:54]** I think we've established that Kevin doesn't like a lot of foods.

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:55]** You guys are going to make fun of me for it.

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:58]** How do you not like bagels?

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:00]** No, it's like sour.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:02]** I don't like sourdoughs and most bagels are like some kind of sourdough.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:03]** What are you talking about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:04]** Most bagels are not sourdough.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:06]** No, most bagels are not.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:07]** No, you can get all kinds, man.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:09]** How do you feel about pizza, Kevin?

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:10]** I love pizza.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:12]** It's the same dough.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:13]** It's bread.

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:15]** It is literally the same dough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:17]** I love the pizza part of the pizza.

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:18]** I don't love the crust.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:19]** Half the time, I don't even eat the crust.

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:20]** Okay, Kev.

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:20]** Stop it.

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:22]** Just going to correct you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:24]** Most bagels are not sourdough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:25]** There's somethings.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:26]** There's somethings that I don't like.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:27]** It's an everything bagel, and I don't like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:28]** Oh, everything bagels are gross.

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:29]** I'm with you there.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:30]** I hate everything bagels.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:31]** Don't have that one.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:32]** No one likes those.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:33]** I don't like everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:36]** I love everything in bagels, but that's me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:37]** Get out of here.

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:38]** Everything is great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:40]** No, there's like bird seed on it and stuff.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:43]** You should just go with the plain one or like a blueberry one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:45]** It's so... Oh, God.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:46]** Garlic bagels, onion bagels.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:47]** You know what kind of bagel I like?

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:49]** I'll tell you what kind of bagel I like.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:50]** Pizza bagel.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:51]** My favorite bagel.

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:51]** Bagel bites.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:53]** I think you really like the cinnamon bagels.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:54]** Yes, that's what I was going to say.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:56]** No, my favorite bagel is a donut.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:58]** Oh, yeah, yeah.

**[00:03:58 - 00:03:59]** Dude, it's not a bagel, though.

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:01]** What's the difference?

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:03]** It's not a bagel if it's not boiled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:06]** Are you, like, a cake donut guy?

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:08]** Or are you, like, a fried donut?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:09]** Oh, I guess, yeah.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:10]** I like all sorts of donuts.

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:11]** Maple bars.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:12]** Maple bacon bars are really good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:15]** Oh, maple bars are the best.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:16]** Those, like, bear claws?

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:17]** Bear claws?

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:18]** Ooh, a good bear claw?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:21]** There's a spot here in town called Mini Bar.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:30]** And they do, like, they've just got a really fundamentally good cake mini donut, but they also fill it with, like, gourmet toppings, and they've got a cookies and cream one that's really good.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:37]** They've got a butterscotch bacon, and it's butterscotch cream cheese frosting with bacon crumbles on top.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:38]** I don't like cream cheese, though.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:41]** And it's so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:42]** Do you have something against cream cheese?

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:44]** I don't like foods in general.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:50]** Dude, I also am not a big schmear guy, but just, like, a light layer, you know?

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:53]** It's just enough to grease the wheels of the bagel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:54]** What about like carrot cake?

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:54]** Ooh.

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:57]** I mean, yeah, I'm here for that.

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:57]** Carrot cake?

**[00:04:58 - 00:05:00]** Wait, so Kevin, what are you going to eat then exactly?

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:02]** Say again, Kelly?

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:05]** You are going to get up at, we all know, at like 5 in the morning or whatever.

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:06]** What are you actually going to eat?

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:09]** Because you're not going to be at the meeting to even refuse the bagels.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:10]** No, I think we're meeting.

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:16]** We actually start at like 8.30 tomorrow because I'm on the East Coast and there's no time change, so it works okay.

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:16]** Okay.

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:19]** But yeah, I'm just going to have coffee in the morning.

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:20]** That's about it.

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:21]** And I'll suffer till lunch.

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:22]** It's fine.

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:25]** No, but you guys are distracting me.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:30]** My whole point of this story is I went out to dinner with my coworkers two nights in a row.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:33]** And both places...

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:38]** We all choose drinks and both places had a smoked martini style drink.

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:39]** Speak my language.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:41]** And now I am now that guy.

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:43]** They're like, oh, Kevin's going to get the smoked whatever.

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:48]** And I even ordered – my meal was chicken and smoked mozzarella ravioli.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:51]** And they were just like, anything smoked, Kevin's going to eat it.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:55]** But the two smoked martinis, the first one came out.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:58]** It was in a glass, just served martini.

**[00:05:58 - 00:06:02]** And then they put like a wooden coaster over it that had a hole in the middle.

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:02]** Yeah.

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:09]** and they used a torch to burn it, and then they put a cap on that, and so the smoke, you know, billowed into the thing.

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:16]** The second one, it was Beauty and the Beast style, like the rose in the glass dome, but it was just, you couldn't even see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:17]** They used it to smoke duck and stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:18]** You couldn't even see the glass.

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:23]** It was just smoke, and then she pulled it off, and there's this martini glass covered in smoke.

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:24]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:27]** I'll say the first one was better than the second one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:31]** Because it creates a convection current inside the glass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:34]** I think just the drink itself was just mixed better on the first one, too.

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:35]** That's also fair.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:42]** But another fun side story for me is that these guys got me some really nice rum for my birthday.

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:43]** Yeah.

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:48]** Both of those drinks were not as good as the rum you gave me straight.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:51]** So I missed that.

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:54]** I don't think I've ever said I missed an alcohol, but I missed that rum.

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:56]** I've only had a sip of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:57]** You finish it up already?

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:58]** You polish it off?

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:00]** Should we shout out to Cotton and Reed?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:02]** Shout out to Cotton and Reed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:04]** They do ship nationwide, right?

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:06]** We're good gift givers, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:07]** Cost an arm and a leg, though.

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:09]** I hope they do, because I just said they did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:10]** Anyways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:11]** Go visit them in D.C.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:12]** That's my story.

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:13]** Happy birthday, Kevin.

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:14]** Thank you all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:17]** Happy birthday, Kevin.

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:17]** Happy birthday.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:18]** Happy birthday.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:19]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:25]** Also, just want to say for my birthday, y'all got me some fantastic glasses with such a kind message.

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:27]** So maybe I'll share it on social media.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:29]** They're so cool.

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:31]** Can't wait to drink some rum.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:33]** I think I paid you.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:34]** Do I have money for that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:39]** We should just not pay anybody anything because sooner or later we're all just going to be equal.

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:40]** Who's your gift, John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:41]** I know, I know.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:41]** Wait, Kev, what?

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:42]** Sooner or later we're all going to what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:51]** Yeah, if we all pay everybody else for the gift for everybody else, then sooner or later it'll all just be equal in the end.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:51 - 00:08:00]** That was like every week from, what was it, 15 to like 25, John and I were just swapping the same hundred bucks back and forth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:02]** Yep, yep.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:03]** Pretty much.

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:05]** In some form or another, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:05]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:07]** Kev, what were you going to say?

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:07]** I don't know.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:10]** I was going to ask you guys, like, I don't know, what's your favorite drink that you've had on travel?

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:12]** But I think it's just time to play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:14]** Oh, hang on.

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:15]** Can I go?

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:15]** Can I go?

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:16]** Can I go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:17]** Well, I can answer that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:20]** Okay, Vinny, go ahead.

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:20]** Okay.

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:23]** It's no, I hope it's not a secret.

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:24]** I love a cruise.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:26]** The destination is the ship.

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:27]** I love the ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:28]** I have never been on one.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:29]** I want to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:30]** Okay.

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:31]** We'll save cruise.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:31]** Let's do it.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:32]** It's funny.

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:33]** We'll save cruise.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:34]** I'm here for that.

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:35]** I think they're terrible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:37]** It depends on the cruise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:39]** Will, you're entitled to your opinion, even if it's wrong.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:42]** Got him.

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:43]** The food's good.

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:44]** The entertainment's good.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:45]** The drinks.

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:47]** I was introduced.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:49]** I really enjoy an old fashioned.

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:51]** I love old-fashioned.

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:57]** However, I was in the schooner bar, shout out Royal Caribbean, and I saw an old-fashioned on the menu.

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:58]** It was something I haven't tried before.

**[00:08:58 - 00:08:59]** I really enjoyed cognac.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:02]** And they had a Hennessy old-fashioned.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:04]** So I ordered it in the schooner bar.

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:07]** Blew my mind.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:08]** No burn.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:11]** It's a little bit sweeter than a normal Old Fashioned.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:16]** But just making it with Hennessy, just that slight change, just completely elevated the drink.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:19]** And what I learned later was, it's not just available in the Schooner Bar.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:21]** You can get it anywhere on the ship.

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:21]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:24]** So you just drink a bunch of these the whole weekend?

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:25]** Hennessy old fashioned.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:28]** So then you just woke up and you're next to the pool and it's like 3 p.m.

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:28]** the next day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:29]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:30]** It was great.

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:30]** I love it.

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:31]** That's great.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:31]** Cool.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:32]** It's a classic.

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:33]** I'll have to try that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:36]** Anybody else have good travel drinks they like to have?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:37]** I have one.

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:39]** Yeah, let's hear it, Will.

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:44]** So if you're ever in Hawaii, there's two places to get a Mai Tai.

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:47]** One of them is sort of, it's good.

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:48]** If you say Duke's, dude, I'm throwing you out.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:49]** No.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:50]** Forget that.

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:51]** No, Monkey Pod Kitchen.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:51]** Okay.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:53]** Okay.

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:54]** Or Monkey Tree, I think.

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:55]** I think it's called.

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:56]** Okay.

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:57]** Monkey Tree.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:57 - 00:09:59]** Shout out Monkey Tree Kitchen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:00]** We got any Hawaii listeners?

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:03]** I think maybe it's monkey.

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:04]** Yeah, it's monkey pod.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:05]** Sorry.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:08]** Monkey pod kitchen.

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:11]** It's named after the monkey pod tree.

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:12]** That's why I was confused.

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:18]** But the Mai Tai on Oahu at the Lalo Autograph Collection Hotel, top notch.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:24]** It's a lilikoi, passion fruit Mai Tai, and it is delicious.

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:25]** Sounds nice.

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:27]** That sounds great.

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:28]** Yeah.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:29]** It's worth the trip.

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:33]** For no other reason to go to Hawaii.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:34]** Just for a month.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:37]** Maybe a Hawaii game store wins our game store gauntlet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:39]** Maybe they do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:45]** For people that are voting, vote for a place that's cool to go to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:49]** Spoiler, nobody knows that we're... I don't know what you're talking about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:50]** Oh, wait, what?

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:51]** Just cut that part.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:53 - 00:11:02]** Fun fact for our listeners, our Game Store Gauntlet on Twitter, we are using that to gauge where we're going to do a Will Save Retreat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:10]** Fun fact, the story around the Michelin stars is that they did it because – and Will, maybe you know the actual truth.

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:15]** My understanding is that if it's a one star – Right.

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:16]** If you would drive to it.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:23]** The higher the stars, the more worth it, the trip for you to just go, to go for that one restaurant alone.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:31]** So three stars is like it is worth the cost to you just to fly to that place and go or drive just to eat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:34]** And five stars mean you should spend your entire life savings to get there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:35]** There's only three stars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:37]** There's only three stars.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:38]** Come on.

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:40]** Everyone knows that.

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:40]** I don't know Michelin stars.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:41]** I thought those were tires.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:42]** Yeah.

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:44]** Well, they are made by the Michelin company.

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:46]** They did it so they could sell more tires.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:48]** So people would be like, oh, I'll drive to this restaurant.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:50]** That's why they did it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:53]** Well, John got to tell us about stars on Michelins.

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:56]** Kelly, do you have a favorite drink that you drink when you're traveling?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:57]** I mean, like, I don't know.

**[00:11:58 - 00:11:59]** I usually just drink a whiskey of some kind.

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:05]** Like, I usually try to drink a local whiskey that's, like, you know, made there.

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:10]** But, like, when I've traveled, mulled wine, like, is not so popular, at least in California.

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:11]** Maybe it's a whole U.S.

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:11]** thing.

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:12]** But try mulled wine.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:14]** You kind of feel like you're in Dickensian times again or something.

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:15]** Mulled wine?

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:16]** It's like warm wine.

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:17]** Wine from mulled?

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:19]** No, M-U-L-L-E-D, I think.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:20]** It's like heated up.

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:21]** Yeah.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:23]** M-U-L-L-E-D.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:23]** Mold wine.

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:24]** Check it out.

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:25]** Isn't it like spiced?

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:26]** Yeah, it's spiced.

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:27]** It has spices in it.

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:28]** It's like a red wine, usually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:33]** I learned about, at these Italian restaurants, I learned that a good Italian restaurant serves grappa.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:39]** And grappa is actually all the extras from grapes from when they're making wine.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:41]** And they turn around and they distill that even further.

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:46]** And that's how you know a true Italian restaurant serves that because I guess it's not – it's a really high alcohol content.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:48]** It's also Greek too.

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:48]** Yeah, I thought it was more Greek.

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:53]** I thought a good Italian restaurant was just the one that has the red cups.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:54]** That's what I learned from the people I was out with.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:56]** That are, like, kind of grainy.

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:58]** They're, like, marble, but they're, like, red and translucent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:00]** You know what I'm talking about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:00]** Yeah.

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:01]** That's, like, every Italian place.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:02]** I don't know about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:04]** I don't know that I've ever been to a real Italian place now.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:07]** I'm, like, questioning every Italian restaurant I've ever been to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:12]** I only know real Italian from Olive Garden.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:14]** Where's the guy here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:21]** I saw a picture recently that was, like, best Italian restaurants in New Jersey, and it was Olive Garden here, Olive Garden there, Olive Garden.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:26]** Wait, is that because New Jersey is terrible?

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:27]** That's what people say, right?

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:29]** I'm sorry, New Jersey.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:30]** I didn't know, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:33]** I feel like New Jersey has to have good Italian food somewhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:35]** Dude, that's where the Sopranos is at.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:38]** It's all made by grandma, though.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:39]** It's not made at a restaurant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:41]** Yeah, you got to get the gabagool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:44]** You got to get somebody's grandma to make it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:46]** Any stressful moment, gabagool will solve it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:48]** Yeah, you know, you've got a good point.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:50]** The best Italian I've had has never been at a restaurant.

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:51]** Thank you.

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:54]** It's always some Italians.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:57]** Vinny, do you remember my sake?

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:58]** Yes.

**[00:13:58 - 00:13:59]** Yeah.

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:00]** Not the drink, the person.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:01]** Right.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:01]** Exactly.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:07]** Saki is a friend of ours who lives like also just on the other side of where my house is from.

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:07]** Hi, Saki.

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:10]** And super cool guy.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:12]** He does fashion now.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:13]** He does jewelry.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:18]** But he was a coach for you Miami football.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:19]** I forget.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:19]** Anyway, super cool guy.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:20]** His family is Greek.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:24]** First time I ever hung out there, they made like homemade calamari.

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:26]** And I've never had good calamari since.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:28]** It's like incredible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:32]** That's the calamari by which you measure all other calamari.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:33]** All calamari.

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:36]** Yeah, like they just had like a total farm in their backyard.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:38]** They just got all their stuff fresh every day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:42]** That's how I was with sushi after visiting Japan.

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:45]** But I got over it and I like sushi again elsewhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:47]** Yeah, sushi in Japan is pretty dope.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:49]** I thought you meant there was a squid farm, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:50]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:52]** That would be really cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:56]** I will only eat sushi now in major metropolitan ocean areas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:57]** Yeah, I feel like L.A.

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:58]** sushi is good.

**[00:14:58 - 00:15:04]** Yeah, I avoid sushi from anywhere between, if you're not at least a coastal state, I'm not going to eat sushi there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:05]** Yeah, that's the tough part.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:08]** Like, I really enjoy sushi because I'm on, like, right on the East Coast.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:12]** But, like, when I travel, I'm going to Tennessee next week.

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:13]** I'm like, oh, let me look up a sushi spot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:16]** And then I start thinking about geography.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:17]** I'm like, oh, maybe not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:18]** Just don't do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:19]** Just get the rolls.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:20]** Just get the rolls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:22]** Unless it's like airdropped in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:25]** Is it true that Mondays are the day when you shouldn't get sushi?

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:29]** Because the sushi is like delivered on Tuesday mornings.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:32]** So any sushi on Monday is like the oldest fish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:37]** I feel like that's fairly dependent on like region and store schedules.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:41]** Because that's like if I want a cheap roll, I'll go to Publix on a Wednesday and pay five bucks.

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:42]** But I don't know.

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:44]** Why though?

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:45]** Why do that to your taste buds?

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:47]** Because I'm hungry and don't have a lot of time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:49]** Well, John, that was your drink of choice.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:50]** Sushi.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:51]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:54]** And because of that, we are out of time.

**[00:15:56 - 00:15:57]** Let's play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:58 - 00:16:01]** I feel like all the lights come down like in Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:04]** I would love to have that one day in like a live, you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:07]** Go turn off all the lights in my hotel room one at a time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:09]** Yeah.

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:10]** We can totally make that happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:18]** Let me just give you guys a quick recap of what happened last week.

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:22]** Last time, we found you guys in the middle of yet another fight with the True Warriors.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:26]** They brought one more to even up the odds.

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:27]** Only it didn't help them.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:33]** Termay summoned an earth elemental that felt right at home on the sandy streets of Kefauk Depot.

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:37]** And you were able to spread out just enough to get the upper hand on these thugs.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:39]** You took out three of them fairly quickly.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:43]** And then the webs shouted, hey, don't kill that one.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:44]** Take him alive.

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:47]** But Termay must not have heard him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:49]** Sorry, webs.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:50]** My mistake.

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:51]** Just don't do it again, Termay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:53]** Yeah, he took about three magic missiles.

**[00:16:54 - 00:17:01]** With those guys out of the way, you guys head off towards the car yards to find Riddle's client.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:02]** The car yards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:03]** The car yards.

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:05]** And the last guard that was with them.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:06]** Vari 13?

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:07]** Vari 13?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:07]** Yeah.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:08]** Vari 13.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:09]** Vari Vari?

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:10]** How are we pronouncing that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:11]** I don't know.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:13]** Vari 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:14]** Oh, yeah, I need to bring up the notes.

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:17]** I feel like it was Vari 8, which is like... I don't know how I said it before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:18]** I thought it was 18.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:19]** I've been saying Vari.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:20]** I thought it was 18, too.

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:22]** No, it's very 13, very 8.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:24]** I thought she was old enough to vote.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:28]** Very 8 was the original one on the Stellar Flare.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:30]** Presumably, very 8 was the 8th iteration, but sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:32]** Presumably.

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:36]** Well, it was the original time that I told you about a variation.

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:36]** A variation?

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:38]** A variation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:39]** Yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck.

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:41]** I think that should count.

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:43]** First punishment?

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:45]** It's been a hot minute since we've doled out a punishment.

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:47]** I'll vote for it.

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:47]** What do you think?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:50]** I don't even know who said that just now.

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:50]** Was it John?

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:52]** That was Vinny.

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:53]** No, it was John.

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:55]** Oh, it was John.

**[00:17:55 - 00:17:56]** John gets a punishment.

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:57]** Yes!

**[00:17:58 - 00:18:00]** Kelly, what's the rule for punishments?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:06]** The rules of punishment are, if you have a punishment, you can use it as inspiration.

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:09]** And it's up to the GM how far you can go with that.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:10]** You can kind of be selective.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:13]** I'm pretty sure inspiration is copyrighted or something.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:15]** So you get a second, you get to re-roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:16]** You get a re-roll?

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:17]** Is that what it is?

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:20]** How do you copyright inspiration?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:22]** The word inspiration has a little C after it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:24]** I mean, the same way you copyright the word apple.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:29]** Wait, is it the same way the birthday song is copyrighted?

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:30]** That seems kind of messed up, though.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:31]** Because, like, everyone has birthdays.

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:32]** I think it's out of copyright.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:33]** Okay, good.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:38]** Well, I think inspiration should be out of copyright because it's, like, a word that, like, exists in the English language.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:39]** That's kind of weird.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:39]** Yeah.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:43]** Whatever Starfinder's equivalent of that is, it's a re-roll, apparently.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:46]** It's a Rick Roll re-roll.

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:47]** We're not here to argue copyrights.

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:49]** But here's the thing you have to do.

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:52]** You have to provide flavor when you're doing it.

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:57]** So in the case of here, John was like, you need to describe what you do.

**[00:18:57 - 00:18:59]** So when you use it, you describe it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:01]** And you have to use it before...

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:23]** the action happens so you can't like roll be like oh no it's oh shit yeah exactly okay cool all right as long as we're established on that do you guys want to go anywhere else before you head to the car yards you're right at the gates you're almost there do you want to make a left or a right and you turn i think we just want to go right to the car yards that's a great idea because that's what i prepared


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:25]** Bam!

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:28]** Moving you over to the car yards.

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:29]** Oh, we're in the car yards here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:31]** Car yards.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:32]** All right, I'm a first-time GM.

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:34]** This is, like, the first map that I've used dynamic lighting.

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:35]** Does it look okay?

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:36]** I don't even know what you guys see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:37]** I can't see anything.

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:38]** It's just a blur, Kevin.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:39]** Oh, wait, now I can.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:40]** Oh, wait.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:41]** There we are.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:45]** Wait, Kevin, there are, like, less cars here than there were at the other places.

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:46]** Is there somebody there?

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:47]** There's less what?

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:49]** There's fewer cars in the car yards.

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:52]** Remember, we battled around cars, and there's none here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:54]** Also, there's a way around this gate.

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:55]** Anyway, okay.

**[00:19:55 - 00:19:58]** So we're looking at... Who's this dude?

**[00:19:58 - 00:20:00]** Kev, can you give us some description?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:00]** Hold on.

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:01]** Wait.

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:02]** Slow down.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:02]** Hold on.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:03]** Let Kevin talk.

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:03]** He's the GM.

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:04]** All right.

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:04]** Go ahead.

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:05]** Slow down, gentlemen.

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:06]** Don't talk over people.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:06]** What's up?

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:11]** So a street at the edge of Kefauk Depot leads to a low barrier...

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:13]** next to a small booth with a glass window.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:19]** Beyond, the road disappears as it winds past several mounds of vehicle parts.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:25]** A sign reads, car yards closed to kafak infestation, no admittance.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:28]** So you do see cars.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:39]** All the gray on this map is going to be literally piles upon piles of car parts and formerly flying vehicles stacked up.

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:48]** But as you once knew from Riddle, she said that these car yards are actually relatively safe and organized.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:51]** And actually some come here.

**[00:20:52 - 00:21:02]** For educational purposes, because the vehicles of Akiton's past are kind of easily identified in styles and forms along these walls.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:03]** That's cool.

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:05]** So welcome to the car yards, gentlemen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:09]** So it's the Kefauk Depot Car Yards and Automotive Museum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:12]** And Automotive Museum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:14]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:14]** You nailed it.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:16]** It's like the Smithsonian, but with dust.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:19]** Wait, what else did you guys say?

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:21]** There was another thing you guys mentioned.

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:22]** Who's this?

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:23]** I see some gentlemen.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:25]** Oh, the guy on the screen that you're pointing at.

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:27]** Okay, so go ahead.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:29]** There's a booth, right?

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:31]** It is a toll booth.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:34]** And that's where the sign is posted on that soul booth, just kind of taped over.

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:35]** The car yards are closed.

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:45]** But Riddle explained that she actually has a permit to go into the car yards during this off-season when the K'foks are mating and getting wild.

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:48]** But at the front of the car yards, you actually see a food cart.

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:50]** And there's a gentleman there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:52]** A fruit cart or a food?

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:53]** Food.

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:53]** A food.

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:54]** Food cart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:55]** F-O-O-D.

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:55]** Food.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:56]** Oh.

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:56]** A food cart.

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:57]** Is it like street food?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:58 - 00:21:59]** Like what's the... Yeah, exactly.

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:04]** So there's a man selling savory snacks, some chips, meat on a stick.

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:05]** Eh, kebab dog.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:07]** Get your kebab dog.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:09]** Anybody looking for kebab dogs?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:13]** Shaq is going to try to sneak around the booth.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:15]** Yeah, Shaq is small enough to do this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:17]** Roll stealth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:19]** Roll stealth.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:20]** Oh, that's not bad.

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:26]** I'm going to grab my brand new set of Starfinder dice.


## Speaker_0

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:27]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:31]** That I got in the mail.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:32]** They're real Starfinder dice.

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:35]** They have the Starfinder symbol as the 20, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:37]** Starfinder logo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:37]** Heyo.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:38]** Sweet.

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:40]** Heyo.

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:45]** 23, yeah, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:48]** This guy doesn't notice anything as you...

## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:16]** Yeah, I don't care if you got a permanent or not.

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:17]** I'm not gutting the shop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:24]** Hey, you see anybody come through these parts recently?

## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:45]** Uh, yeah, this guy is charmed by all means.

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:51]** Hey, yeah, the, the saw this Android the other day, they went in there with this big tall guy.

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:53]** Um, but he was cool.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:55]** They, they bought two Catholic dogs off of me.

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:57]** Um,

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:59]** But I haven't seen them come back out.

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:01]** But I'm only here until like 5 p.m.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:06]** So Thaddeus like asks him, isn't this place closed for today?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:08]** Hasn't it been closed for a while?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:11]** Oh, it's closed per se.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:14]** But like people still come in and there ain't nobody here to guard the gate except me.

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:16]** And I ain't guard nothing.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:19]** So like, yeah, it's closed, but it's like not actually closed.

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:20]** You know what I mean?

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:23]** It's just not recommended to go in there because it's kind of dangerous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:28]** So why are you here selling your sticks of meat and so on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:34]** It doesn't seem like a place with good enough foot traffic for you to make some decent cash, yeah?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:41]** I mean, I sold two the other day, and I'm willing to sell you guys some if you want any, so it's pretty good business for me.

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:43]** It's awfully suspicious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:52]** While this conversation's happening, Chuck is ambling over in his little vines or starting to creep up to the table to try to snatch a meat on a stick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:54]** Go ahead and roll another stealth for that.

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:56]** Are you going to actually attempt to steal?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:58]** Yeah, he's going to try to snag one.

**[00:25:58 - 00:25:59]** Slide a hand.

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:00]** You're trying to steal it?

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:01]** And I can assist, right?

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:03]** You're trying to stealth it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:06]** You cannot assist on a steal unless you're going to try to distract him with something.

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:07]** Distract him.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:08]** I would distract him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:08]** 24.

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:09]** 24.

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:11]** 24.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:12]** Entertain.

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:14]** I don't think you need to try to distract.

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:16]** You get to take a hot dog from this guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:19]** You see it start to slide up the side like ivy.

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:24]** And it creeps on top, wraps around a hot dog, and just swipes it away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:27]** You know, I'll take one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:29]** We're a little steps up.

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:34]** I was going to ask, if I were to eat, do I get any stamina back?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:36]** I don't think so.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:36]** I don't know.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:38]** I'd have to look up the rules on eating food.

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:40]** But I'd actually... Heal damage?

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:41]** No.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:46]** I mean, I wouldn't say this is the best food, so you probably get a minus something if you do actually eat it.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:47]** Let's just call it even.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:51]** Hey, Rolus steps up.

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:51]** You want just one?

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:53]** There are seven credits a pop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:55]** Rolus eyes get a little big.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:57]** I just ate, unfortunately.

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:00]** But thank you, sir.

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:02]** And I give him like a couple credits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:03]** Oh, that's sweet.

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:05]** I'll swipe my card for the information.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:07]** All right.

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:09]** One Kefauk dog for you guys.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:11]** Oh, you guys are going to share?

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:12]** Even the name sounds unappealing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:23]** So could you, and this is like in between bites of food, can you tell us anything more about the two dogs, the individuals who bought those other dogs the other day?

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:25]** Did they say anything interesting?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:29]** One said, can I get two Kefauk dogs?

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:30]** And I was like, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:31]** It's riveting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:34]** The other one had long green braids.

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:34]** I don't know.

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:35]** Does that help you?

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:37]** Sure, it does.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:39]** You said he was tall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:42]** Whoa, where'd... What the... What are you doing back there?

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:43]** Hi.

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:43]** Are you eating a Kefauk dog?

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:44]** You didn't pay for that.

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:46]** What Kefauk dog?

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:49]** And he, like, unhinges his jaw and just throws it straight down.

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:55]** I'm going to need you to swipe your card against for this monkey thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:58]** He's not with me, per se.

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:00]** He's tagging along.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:00]** Here.

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:02]** But... Brolu just taps.

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:03]** Here you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:04]** Thank you.


## Speaker_0

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:06]** Just taps it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:09]** And no one else?

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:11]** That's been your only business?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:14]** I mean, last couple days, yeah, it's been kind of slow.

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:20]** Usually the weekend picks up, but it's like a Tuesday, so... You mentioned this place is pretty dangerous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:22]** What do you mean?

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:25]** This is our first time here, so... Well, the fox...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:27]** you know, the food you're eating right now.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:29]** They come from the Kaphaxin side.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:33]** And this time of year, the Kaphaxin get kind of frisky.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:35]** And they're a little wild.

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:36]** Just be careful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:42]** Any advice on taking a down if we were to encounter a formidable force?

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:44]** I mean, I ain't never fought one myself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:47]** I usually buy the meats off of people that come out of here.

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:48]** What's up with your cat friend?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:51]** Fatty is just looking at him suspiciously.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:55]** He's just going to roll a sense motive just for a 20, just to see.

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:58]** Is he really just trying to sell us stuff, or is he maybe a lookout for someone?

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:00]** You rolled a 20?

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:01]** A nat 20.

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:02]** Dang.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:03]** So what's your total bonus for?

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:06]** It's 20 altogether, but it's a natural 20.

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:07]** So you have a zero?

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:08]** What?

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:09]** No, no, no.

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:10]** Oh, yeah, zero bonus.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:11]** What's your sense motive?

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:12]** It's zero, so.

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:13]** Okay, so 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:19]** You can tell that he's, like, selling food, but he's not being completely honest about the food he's selling.

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:20]** Okay.

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:22]** If that makes any sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:23]** Is that it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:26]** I mean, like, he's definitely not, like, he's a pretty shit dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:31]** He's not a lookout for someone else, like, seeing people coming in, like, reporting on people coming in, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:34]** I'm not sure you would know that from a sense motive check.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:35]** Yeah, really?

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:37]** Did you see his eyes twitching funny?

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:40]** Like, what would a sense motive check actually tell you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:41]** I don't know.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:44]** Maybe I see, like, a comm unit on his person or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:45]** Perception or something?

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:48]** Yeah, that's what I was thinking, was going to do a perception to see if he has any.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:49]** On the meat?

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:52]** Meat, article, clothing, something in their pocket.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:53]** I'll give you this.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:54]** Roll perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:55]** Okay, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:58 - 00:30:19]** 22 14 not i got 12 that's not that great go ahead so rolo notices that the hot dogs have been soaking for a while because the the water is pretty brown it's like new york uh hot dogs i'm i'm not gonna judge anybody on their hot dog stands uh wait do you not like hot dogs too

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:21]** I love hot dogs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:22]** I love hot dogs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:26]** Kev's favorite hot dog is a 7-Eleven hot dog.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:28]** That should tell you everything you need to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:32]** I wouldn't say it's my favorite, but it's definitely up there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:35]** About Kev's taste.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:46]** But I'll say for what you see in this guy, he doesn't have anything indicating that he's a part of anything or there's nothing that makes him stand out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:52]** He's just a weird, terrible businessman who does business at inconvenient times and places, but whatever.

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:52]** All right, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:56]** Yeah, he's the falafel guy from Batman.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:56 - 00:31:00]** Can I pick his pockets and see if he's got anything on him?

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:01]** We could just rob him, I guess.

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:03]** We are pirates.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:05]** You already stole one dog.

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:07]** You guys want to fight this dude?

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:08]** We paid him for the dogs.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:10]** No, I just don't want to fight him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:14]** I was just going to rummage through his pockets a little bit.

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:15]** He was made whole.

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:16]** Yeah, we paid for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:41]** rolu as he's taking the last bite is just gonna say he's gonna hey one last thing oh how long are people usually in here you see him same day you know some some people go in there for only a couple hours other people like to camp in there it's a little weird to me but the cayons are pretty big but again like i i don't know if those people came out or not i'm not here all the time only didn't peak hours like when you gentlemen came through

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:41]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:42]** What time is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:43]** Like, mid-morning?

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:44]** Yeah, it's pretty... Right?

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:45]** Because we got up pretty early.

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:46]** Yeah.

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:47]** We got up at Kevin times.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:51]** Hey, what is a Kefak?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:53]** Yeah, it's... I'll be honest.

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:56]** I ain't never actually seen one because I don't go too far in there.

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:58]** But they taste okay, right?

**[00:31:58 - 00:31:59]** And he points to...

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:00]** Rolu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:03]** How have you never seen one?

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:11]** So, sorry, your supplier are people who bring you Kefauks, but you... Hey, man, I'm not going to answer any more questions about my supply chain, okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:14]** Unless you guys are some kind of, like, office of the law and you're going to come in here.

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:22]** What, Abadarkor all of a sudden going to be coming in here sending pirate-looking dudes to tell me how to run my business?

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:24]** Hey, do you want some more Kefauk or not?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:27]** Yes, we are from Abadarkor.

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:28]** How did you know?

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:30]** Let me see your badges.

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:31]** All right, we're going to get going now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:36]** All right, I guess we're going to start going, I guess.

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:39]** Just watch out for animals.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:46]** Hey, if we brought you back some kefak, would you dole us a couple credits?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:52]** I'll give you about five credits for every ten pounds of kefak meat you bring me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:53]** It's got to be prepared.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:56]** I'm going to roll a sense motive because he said a strange word, dollar.

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:56]** Dollar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:58]** Roll your sense motive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:58 - 00:32:59]** What is a dollar?

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:03]** No, I'm not going to roll a sense motive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:09]** You realize he was genuine about his same credits, but he's probably upcharging you a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:10]** Yeah, of course he is.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:11]** Chuck would run these numbers.

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:12]** He's like, wait a minute.

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:14]** $7 for a dog.

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:17]** $5 for 10 pounds.

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:18]** Half a credit per pound.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:19]** He's got to process them too, man.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:23]** You guys don't know what goes on behind this cart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:25]** He seasons them with some allspice.

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:28]** Some awful good margins for K'fok dogs.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:31]** Seems like a good business you got running here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:33]** This is like going to a baseball game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:36]** Are you accredited with the BBB?

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:38]** Sorry, with the ABB?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:39]** I got some beer too.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:41]** It's going to be 15 credits apiece.

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:44]** For an eight ounce cane.

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:47]** Because ounces carry over to Starfinder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:48]** And it's somehow stale.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:51]** The metric system is everywhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:53]** Yeah, it's stale somehow.

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:56]** Thank you so much for your time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:58]** Yeah, you guys have a good day.

**[00:33:58 - 00:33:59]** Be careful in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:02]** We'll bring you back some fox when we kill them.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:03]** Rollo's going to step forward.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:03]** Sound good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:07]** Thaddeus will inch forward with Rollo, taking up the front.

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:08]** Rollo will step up too.

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:10]** I'll stay with you guys.

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:13]** Looks like some downed starships or engines or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:14]** All right, cool.

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:19]** As you guys start to walk away, going back into this cavernous wall,

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:21]** And it wraps around.

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:28]** Jediah, who is standing at the cart, actually turns away from you, pulls his phone out.

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:29]** What the fuck?

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:37]** Just text, Ayo, Joey, there's some people here, and they're looking for those two you were asking about.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:40]** and hit send naturally.

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:41]** That's the end of that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:42]** Moving on.

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:46]** Hey, well, since we noticed him, can't we ask him about that?

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:46]** What do you mean?

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:47]** You just said that out loud.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:50]** Yeah, were you telling us that because we noticed him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:51]** No, no, you guys didn't notice him.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:52]** You're walking away.

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:53]** I'm telling you that.

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:56]** It cuts back to him cinematically.

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:59]** Ah, cinematically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:02]** So we don't know, but you just told us that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:04]** Yeah, it's called storytelling, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:06]** That's fine.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:10]** And we weren't able to pick this up from... But we weren't able to pick this up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:11]** You're right.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:13]** You didn't see the phone in his pocket.

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:14]** Like, it's just a phone.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:15]** All right, all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:17]** I tried to pickpocket him, and you said I couldn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:18]** I did not say you couldn't.

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:20]** I said you could if you wanted to fight him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:21]** No, I was going to do a sleight of hand.

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:22]** I was going to create a diversion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:23]** That was your choice.

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:25]** You walked away.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:29]** He then sent a text message to somebody, and I happened to tell you what the text message says.

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:31]** Well, here we go, I guess.

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:34]** I guess I got to roll higher next time.

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:35]** Go ahead and pause there on the map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:39]** The lesson is kick people's asses, apparently, so that way you know what to have on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:40]** Fight and kill everybody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:41]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:43]** Or let a GM tell a story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:45]** Cool.

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:46]** We've paused movement.

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:47]** What happens next?

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:49]** All right.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:49]** Yeah.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:49]** What are we doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:54]** The sounds of the city grow muffled near the surrounding heaps of scrap and debris.

**[00:35:55 - 00:36:00]** The path widens a little, zigzagging around collections of vehicles sorted by type.

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:06]** Internal combustion engines over here, electric power cores, and even some ancient clockwork mechanisms.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:11]** Um, and so you see these as you, what can you guys see on your map?

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:12]** I'm curious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:18]** Cause I don't really, I can kind of see, but I can't see like a bunch of like just shredded up engine looking things to the left.

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:18]** Okay.

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:19]** That's all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:22]** So this, this area is called the engine block.

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:27]** And so that's each of those piles is a separate mechanism, essentially, you know,

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:31]** varieties of the same mechanism piled together in each pile.

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:34]** So one is an engine or, you know, a miniature block.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:36]** The other one is a power course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:37]** So got it.

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:38]** Yeah.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:39]** Uh, which one of these is cover?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:42]** Oh, boy, look.

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:43]** It's a valid question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:47]** Each of them are six feet tall.

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:51]** Six feet.

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:56]** So I can look over them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:58]** How high are these stacks?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:02]** The stacks are at least 12 feet tall.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:03]** Oh, okay.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:05]** The walls are very tall.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:06]** What are effectively walls.

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:08]** But the stacks are around six feet tall.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:08]** Got it.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:10]** You know, varying heights.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:10]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:12]** And the Kefauk guy, how tall was he?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:17]** He was five foot four-ish.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:17]** Oh.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:17]** Okay.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:23]** Because, you know, feet and inches carry over to Starfinder as well.

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:25]** Right.

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:25]** Cool.

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:27]** So from here, yeah.

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:27]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:28]** I don't know.

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:29]** What do you guys want to do?

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:33]** I think Rollo's just going to, as he turns the corner, can I move him forward?

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:34]** Is that cool?

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:35]** Yeah, go right ahead.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:45]** He's going to take, probably just step over to where Jack is and going to roll a perception check as we're looking off to the left here at like four or five of these cool engine blocks.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:48]** I also will look around.

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:55]** I feel like the air is really hot and there's probably a lot of smell of rusted old things and...

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:56]** I don't know.

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:58]** It's a cool image in my head.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:00]** Yeah.

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:03]** And that's all that I can see because I rolled a six.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:03]** Six total.

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:14]** Thaddeus rolls stealth for a 19, and then he's going to roll perception as well and just kind of, he's going to perceive, and depending on that, walk into the, well, he didn't perceive well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:17]** I have a 16 on my perception.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:24]** So Chak is going to look for any traces of the android and his tall companion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:25]** What are you going to roll for that?

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:26]** I know the answer.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:27]** I was just curious what you were going to say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:27]** You tell me.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:28]** You're the GM.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:28]** Okay.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:30]** Well, you're going to have to roll survival check for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:31]** It's a straight D20.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:32]** Let's go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:54]** dang um so not knowing anything about uh you got a three trace i got a three you got a three wait i thought you rolled a natural 20 no he said straight d20 oh perfect okay so my my answer doesn't change um there's a lot of footprints on the ground cool okay so who all rolled perception what was the highest


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:55]** I got a 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:58]** Yeah, I think Traumated was the highest.

**[00:38:58 - 00:39:08]** Okay, so looking at the walls of the car yard wrap around, and then you see three of these piles.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:14]** And with your perception, you see that the piles aren't stable.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:19]** They're kind of wiggling, and you're not certain why.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:21]** The engine block piles are wiggling?

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:25]** Yeah, like not the entire thing, but like parts of it.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:27]** It's just a little shaky.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:29]** It could be hiding covers.

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:33]** Like small creatures might be in the midst.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:35]** Yeah, can I do like an – I'm trying to think.

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:37]** Maybe engineering or some science.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:38]** Life science.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:39]** To see what that might be.

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:40]** I don't think you can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:41]** Okay.

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:42]** Life science?

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:44]** Could I detect if there's animals?

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:45]** Probably not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:48]** Unless you want to be more specific about what your life sciencing –


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:50]** I'm going to cast Detect Magic.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:54]** I mean, I was just going to be like, yeah, just to see if there's creatures in there.

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:59]** Does the movement seem like a creature's movement, moving them around?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:02]** I'd have to look up exactly what life science says.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:04]** Okay, that means yes, probably.

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:06]** So let's see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:08]** Go ahead, John.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:17]** Yeah, I think Rolo's going to kind of mutter under his breath, and one of his arms is going to make a movement with his fingers, and he's going to cast Detect Magic.

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:22]** Magic, which has a range of 60 feet in a cone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:32]** I'll say overall there is like a dull, a very, very dull magic, but it's not coming from the pie.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:38]** Like it just seems very evenly displaced, like absolutely even around you.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:39]** So there's nothing.

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:42]** What's the word for stronger than nothing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:46]** Maybe it's like just the magic that is like faint.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:46]** Yeah.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:52]** It's like the faint echo or the faint remnant of the magic that's used to make these cars run.

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:53]** Right.

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:56]** Because obviously magic and technology are paired together.

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:57]** So interesting.

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:58]** At least that's what Rolo thinks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:02]** I'm just saying there's nothing stronger coming from those piles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:03]** Yeah, keep your eyes peeled.

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:04]** Did the life science work, man?

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:09]** It's basically just like you can recall knowledge about biology.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:15]** And there's also identified creatures, but we're not being specific because we don't know there is a creature.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:16]** What do you think?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:22]** Yeah, if you guys are being any more specific, I might give you something, but you can't just life science an engine block and tell me what it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:26]** Okay, how about, like, is it like a Kaffok or whatever the hell they're called?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:27]** Go ahead and roll a life science check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:28]** All right, thank you.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:31]** I'm going to sense if there's any creatures in there if you want to help out.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:33]** It's a little bit suspicious.

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:35]** I can't see anything.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:37]** I'm not trained in life science.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:39]** Yeah, I don't think I'm trained either.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:42]** Thaddeus, even though he killed a lot of creatures, can't really figure it out.

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:43]** I think it's just a 12.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:44]** Is that good enough?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:45]** You rolled a 12.

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:47]** Can I roll a culture?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:52]** Life science is the only thing I let you guys roll, and you rolled a 12.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:53]** Yeah.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:54]** Yeah.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:56]** To you, it looks like an engine block.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:57]** Okay.

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:59]** Well, it's an engine block that's swaying.

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:00]** So what do you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:06]** All I know is that they're swaying, and I would keep my distance.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:08]** I don't know if something's in there or not.

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:10]** But on alert, everyone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:11]** Be alert.

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:15]** There's a low level of faint sense of magic here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:17]** Let's go find out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:19]** Shaq starts toddling over.

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:22]** Shaq, you can go in the piles if you want.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:27]** Before we get close to them, looking at it, it looks unstable, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:29]** I wouldn't say it looks unstable.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:32]** Parts of it look unstable.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:33]** It's not like the whole thing is teetering over.

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:34]** That's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:45]** I'm going to use psychokinetic hand to dislodge a small piece from this pile that I think might collapse it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:48]** What is the strength on psychokinetic hand?

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:50]** It's 10 pounds, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:51]** Yeah, 10 pounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:54]** Does 10 pounds carry over to Starfinder?

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:55]** I'm asking for a friend.

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:58]** Okay, I'll say that first one's an engine block.

**[00:42:58 - 00:42:59]** One bulk.

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:08]** And when you do the psychokinetic hand, you see just a valve cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:35]** part of an engine block kind of pop off float up in the air and then get thrown aside because that's probably what your cyclocanon can is doing and as you do that you see something that is not quite metallic or engine engine blockish what can you see roll anything on that you can roll life science you're not trained right i don't i'm not trained in life science what do you what do you see

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:38]** There is something not metal in there.

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:39]** Oh, really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:40]** He rolls the life science again.

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:41]** 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:45]** Can I see what color it was?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:47]** Is it an animal?

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:49]** Yeah, just a little more description.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:54]** It's almost like a rust color.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:56]** Something rusty but not metal.

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:57]** That's not helpful.

**[00:43:58 - 00:43:59]** Like a brownish.


## Speaker_0

**[00:43:59 - 00:43:59]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:02]** Does it look biological?

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:04]** It does not look metallic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:07]** It's rust colored, but it's not metallic, is what I'll tell you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:09]** Okay, so we don't know if it was a creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:13]** The thing is, you guys are definitely beating around the bush on this one.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:18]** You guys clearly understand what's going on, but your characters don't, is what I'm going to tell you.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:24]** Your characters don't know what is going on in these piles, but clearly you guys know that these are...

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:26]** Well, we do know that it's swaying, though, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:27]** We know that much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:29]** Our character is swaying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:30]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:32]** Yeah, I mean, we would know that there's a creature.

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:33]** I don't think you need to jump to it.

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:35]** We would know that there's something in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:36]** It's suspicious, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:38]** Yeah, dude, it's good.

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:39]** We'll see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:40]** Don't be suspicious.

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:43]** Thaddeus told everyone already, just be careful of what happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:51]** There are narrow corridors here, so I'm thinking we need to... The Falafel guy literally said, look out for Kha'Fox.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:53]** Yeah, so I think we're good.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:54]** Okay.

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:59]** Let's try and stay together and not split up around these piles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:00]** Let's stay in a line here.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:01]** That's a good plan.

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:02]** Stay on alert.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:07]** I'd recommend having something ready, spells ready, weapons at arms.

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:08]** Okay, let's go.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:11]** For the second time, I agree with you, Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:14]** I think Shaq is going to Leroy Jenkins this.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:16]** Of course Shaq will, but everyone be careful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:17]** Yeah, of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:18]** Okay.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:18]** Okay.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:22]** All right, well, Thaddeus has his gun ready to go.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:23]** He just has a shot ready to fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:25]** He just ambles.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:28]** Jack ambles over and starts climbing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:30]** So, Jack, you walk forward first?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:30]** Yeah.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:30]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:32]** Who is behind Jack?

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:32]** Thaddeus.

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:33]** I guess I'll go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:34]** Probably should.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:35]** And then Rolo will go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:36]** Okay, let's pause there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:39]** I have both my weapons out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:40]** Wait, did you both close?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:42]** That's what Shaq does.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:44]** Shaq's character is just like, f*** it.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:45]** It just goes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:48]** Hold on, I can't move you.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:49]** It's like, let me get the pieces ready.

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:50]** Back to where you were.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:53]** You were like there.

**[00:45:53 - 00:46:06]** Yeah, so now, as Choc moves forward, he approaches the first pile, and that rust piece that you see, the head does pop out, and it is definitely a K'vok.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:07]** Dun, dun, dun!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:09]** What do they look like?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:19]** Yeah, what I will say is that I'm not going to make this one get a surprise round on you guys, because you didn't just walk into it blindly, but I'm not going to give you guys any kind of advantage either.

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:22]** So let me...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:24]** Does that mean we're in it?

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:26]** I'm waiting for him to say the magic words.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:28]** We're going to RFID it.

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:30]** Roll for initiative.

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:31]** There they are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:36]** 20.

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:38]** Dang.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:39]** All right, Kev.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:40]** Let's, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:40]** 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:41]** Oh, wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:42]** This is what they look like.

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:43]** Does somebody want to describe them?

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:45]** It's a scorpion crab.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:47]** It's a... Yeah.

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:50]** It's a wormy centipede scorpion thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:50]** Yeah.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:51]** It's a scorpion crab.

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:53]** The head sort of looks like an armadillo head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:54]** That's true.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:54]** Yeah.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:57]** Like a scorpion armadillo shrimp crab.

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:58]** It's kind of shrimp-like, yeah.

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:04]** So crab claws, like shrimp head, armadillo scales, and the body of a scorpion.

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:05]** Pretty cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:07]** I would say more of a centipede than a scorpion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:09]** Yeah, I was thinking like shrimp feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:09]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:10]** Shrimp legs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:11]** They're pretty cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:12]** Shrimp legs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:13]** It's like a crawdad.

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:15]** They're like a crawdad.

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:19]** If you want to follow along at home, it's spelled K-H-E-F-A-K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:19]** Check it out.

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:20]** Pretty cool.

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:22]** Kind of like Kavok Depot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:23]** How big are they?

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:26]** On its chest, it looks like it has another mouth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:28]** That does look like, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:29]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:29]** Ooh, yeah.

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:30]** That's awesome.

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:30]** Gross.

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:31]** That's super gross.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:34]** So go ahead and tell me what you guys each rolled for initiatives.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:36]** You should call us out one by one so we don't all shout.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:37]** One by one.

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:38]** I'll take a volunteer.

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:39]** Kelly.

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:40]** I roll a 20.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:42]** You roll a 20.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:42]** 20.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:43]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:46]** I also rolled a 20, but it was dirty.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:47]** A dirty 20.

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:48]** Yeah, mine was also a dirty 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:49]** So who has a higher bonus?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:50]** I also got a dirty 20.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:51]** I have a plus one.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:52]** I have a plus two.

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:53]** I have a plus three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:55]** You all rolled 20s?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:55]** Yes.

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:57]** I got a 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:57]** Okay, so.

**[00:47:59 - 00:47:59]** Dice cam.

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:01]** Cops, webs, Tremaine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:05]** Cobb, Weps, Tremay.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:07]** And Chak, what did you get?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:07]** I got a 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:08]** I got a 12.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:10]** Okay, hold on.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:10]** Sorry.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:11]** I got to do this.

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:11]** So 20.3.

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:17]** And then Tremay, you got Cobb, Weps, and then Tremay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:17]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:20]** Okay, so Weps gets 20.2.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:23]** And Tremay gets 20.1.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:26]** Okay, what did you get, Chuck?

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:27]** 12.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:29]** 12.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:30]** All right.

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:36]** Let me just do this real quick.

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:36]** Sort.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:43]** For the listener at home, I like to use Excel sheets for this because it's fun.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:45]** Such an engineer.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:46]** If I did it right?

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:47]** Did I do it right?

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:48]** Oh, I messed that up.

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:49]** Hold on a second.

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:52]** We're gonna cut this.

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:53]** Guess who gets to go first?

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:55]** Dude, the Kefauk.

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:55]** The Kefauk does?

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:56]** That's right.

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:59]** Oh, jeez.

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:02]** That's just how it worked out.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:09]** So the Kafak, the first one that just reached out, is clearly going to take in a... The first one?

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:10]** The first one.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:11]** Yeah, the first one.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:15]** Out of the 17 that you're going to see in the next two days.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:22]** The first one is going to do a claw attack.

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:23]** On check?

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:24]** Of course.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:26]** Dude, check.

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:29]** No.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:30]** It's a six on the die with a plus four.

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:33]** Does a ten hit you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:33]** Boo.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:35]** Got to be faster than that, buddy.

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:36]** Ten.

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:36]** Ten does not hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:37]** Okay.

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:39]** So it swings at you.

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:41]** You're far enough away, and it misses.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:42]** How big are these things?

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:43]** They are small.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:44]** Small.

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:46]** And how many hit points do they have?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:46]** Yep.

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:46]** 47.

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:47]** Oh, wow.

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:47]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:49]** I have to look that up.

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:52]** It's roughly the same as a troll polyp.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:53]** Cool.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:56]** All right, Rolo, it is your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:59]** Depending on if you crit.

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:00]** How much does it weigh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:02]** Roll a life science.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:04]** It's rude to ask Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:07]** Yeah.

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:08]** All right, Rolo, it's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:13]** All right, Rolo is going to... I think Rolo is going to shout...

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:15]** Check, find some cover.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:22]** And then going to two sets of arms are going to come up with the azimuth serpent laser.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:24]** Going to full attack and fire.

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:30]** First one rolled a six, which I don't think hits.

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:32]** Six does not hit.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:34]** And then roll the three.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:37]** Wow, this d20 is destroying me.

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:40]** I feel like it's the Kefok dog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:42]** No, that's going to destroy you later.

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:43]** What bonuses are you taking on that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:45]** I did a full attack.

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:46]** Minus one, minus one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:48]** Wait, it should be minus four, minus four.

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:50]** Do you have a plus three normally?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:51]** Yeah.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:51]** So it's minus one, minus one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:52]** Just checking.

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:53]** Just checking your math.

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:58]** Roller shoots twice, and you miss both times.

**[00:50:58 - 00:51:01]** Probably blow some of the engine block components out.

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:01]** Nope.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:03]** No, you miss.

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:04]** It shoots off into space.

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:07]** Moving on to Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:08]** Okay.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:12]** I think he can do a quick reload, perhaps.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:13]** Is that possible?

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:14]** Sorry.

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:15]** Just checking right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:16]** Why would you need to do a quick reload?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:19]** Well, because I don't want to use my poison darts on this guy.

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:21]** I could use regular stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:24]** Sorry, I forget your weapon, but your weapon has six shots in it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:26]** Yeah, but I have more on me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:31]** I would say you would alternate them without any kind of action.

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:32]** Nice.

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:40]** If you had three poison darts in there, as long as you kept count of your total, then I'd say you can just shoot.

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:41]** Okay, cool.

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:43]** It's like a revolver.

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:44]** Just spin it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:45]** Thaddeus does that.

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:46]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:47]** All right, cool.

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:48]** We'll do that.

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:49]** Does a 15 hit?

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:51]** A 15 does, in fact, hit.

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:53]** Oh, nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:54]** Let's see how much damage you do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:55]** All right.

**[00:51:57 - 00:52:02]** 1d8 plus.

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:03]** Pardon me?

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:04]** Pulling out the will dice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:07]** Would you say 1d8 plus 14?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:08]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:10]** Let's call it that.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:11]** Five damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:13]** Five damage.

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:14]** Nice.

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:16]** Bam!

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:26]** This kafok gets hit in the side of the head, and its carapace splits into two, and it turns an eye at you, and it looks furious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:28]** Of course it does.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:29]** What does it sound like?

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:32]** How rude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:33]** It's good jittering.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:33]** It's all right.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:35]** It's not that scary.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:36]** Yeah.

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:39]** That was a good jittering, Kelly.

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:42]** And then 15 crawl out of the walls behind you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:44]** It was a good jittering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:46]** It was very realistic, but we got this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:47]** All right.

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:50]** Well, now it is Chuck's turn.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:51]** I thought it was Tormay's turn.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:52]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:53]** I think it's Tormay's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:53]** Oh, you're right.

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:54]** It is Tormay's turn.

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:54]** Yeah.

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:55]** My bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:56]** Always just.

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:57]** Got distracted.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:20]** hard man yeah yeah to me seeing this creature miss is going to walk up five feet let me just walk up real quick to get in range and cast stumble yeah oh i hope it works okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:23]** Does there a roll against that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:25]** There's a DC 14.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:31]** So basically you momentarily transpose the position of the limbs of the target.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:36]** To move or interfere with its perception.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:44]** If the target fails its reflex save, it's off target and can move only half its speed for one round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:46]** And what happens if it passes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:48]** Nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:50]** Then nothing happens to this Kvok.

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:53]** Your spell just kind of poof, poof.

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:54]** Also, a question.

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:57]** Are there any stipulations to that?

**[00:53:58 - 00:53:59]** Nope, I don't think there would be.

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:00]** Okay, go ahead.

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:01]** Is that your turn?

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:02]** That's it.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:03]** Yeah, that's my turn.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:05]** All right, Chuck, it's your turn now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:14]** Chuck is going to use one of his abilities called Not in the Face.

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:15]** Not in the Face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:16]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:27]** It is basically a, like, I can turn to a certain enemy and say, not in the face, and it has to make a DC 13 will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:29]** Will save!

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:31]** Will save!

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:33]** Question, does that work on mindless creatures?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:36]** Will save.

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:36]** Will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:37]** Maybe.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:41]** Because it's a will save, and I feel like mindless means it doesn't work that way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:45]** Ah, this is a good stipulation there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:50]** Creature has no intelligence score modifier and is immune to mind-affecting effects.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:52]** Is this a mind-affecting effect?

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:52]** Mind thrust.

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:55]** But it's not in the face of mind-affecting effect?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:56]** I don't know, I'm asking.

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:57]** That's what I'm looking for.

**[00:54:57 - 00:55:03]** It is a mind-affecting improvisation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:06]** Ah...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:07]** Sad.

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:07]** Boo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:09]** Sad.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:09]** Boo.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:13]** So I'm going to let you have this opportunity.

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:21]** Do you commit to this and be a good player, or do you want to backtrack and be a bad player?

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:22]** You're so bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:23]** You're so bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:27]** I'm giving you an opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:28]** I think you should be a bad player.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:32]** You basically said, you can either suck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:34]** I didn't say suck.

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:36]** Those words did not come out of my mouth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:40]** Your dog is eating an avocado.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:42]** I mean, I'm definitely not going to retcon it now.

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:44]** Not that the gauntlet's been thrown down.

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:53]** And Chuck is going to take a guarded step to here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:54]** Nice.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:56]** And that is the end of round one.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:57]** Round one.

**[00:55:58 - 00:56:02]** We're moving into round two.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:04]** And it goes right back to the K'vok.

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:07]** And so the K'vok... Bring it, K'vok.

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:16]** So the K'vok is going to take that step forward towards you and swing its claw at Chuck.

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:17]** Whoa.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:20]** This dirty K'vok claw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:21]** And it misses.

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:23]** Misses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:27]** Yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck.

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:27]** Yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck.

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:28]** Slams into the side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:30]** Rolu, it's now your turn again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:35]** Does it slam into the side of the wall and then something falls and crushes it and kills it immediately?

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:36]** Nope.

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:38]** Splatters can fuck everywhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:44]** It just kind of steps forward and it just kind of swipes and it doesn't even hit a leaf.

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:47]** It just misses completely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:47]** Oh, dang.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:48]** Okay.

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:48]** Okay.

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:50]** Chalk just kind of does like the Matrix.

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:52]** All of his leaves.

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:55]** With all of his tendrils just like whipping back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:56]** Amazing.

**[00:56:57 - 00:56:59]** Which confuses the K'vok and that's why he misses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:01]** Yeah.

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:20]** All right, I think Rolo is going to take a step here, step down, and step right up to where the K'fok is and going to use the tactical spear to skewer this K'fok.

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:21]** Skewer?

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:24]** Turn it into a K'fok dog.

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:29]** That is a 14.

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:33]** Does that hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:34]** That hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:36]** Yeah!

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:39]** Gonna turn you into a Kefauk dog.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:46]** Yet, that's three points of damage skewering this creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:48]** Sure enough, you skewer it.

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:53]** It kind of screeches out in pain and falls limp.

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:58]** And your spear is stuck in this Kefauk now.


## Speaker_0

**[00:57:58 - 00:57:58]** Ha!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:58 - 00:58:02]** How's that for meat on a stick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:04]** Wait, but is it dead?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:05]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:06]** It's dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:08]** Ah, yeah.

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:10]** One and done.

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:10]** Wow.

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:10]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:13]** See how the big red X over it tells you it's dead?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:14]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:17]** Well, there's that big red X. Are we still in initiative order?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:21]** Check listens intently for any more chittering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:21]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:23]** And now we know what's listening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:25]** Roll a perception check.

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:26]** Roll a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:28]** 18.

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:29]** 19.

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:32]** I won't even give mine.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:33]** It's 11.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:43]** You definitely hear the chittering, but it's almost like the same sense that you got from the magic blanket.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:48]** You hear the chittering kind of equally all around you.


## Speaker_0

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:49]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:51]** Guys, I think we might be walking into a K'vok nest.

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:59]** But I'll also say with that higher perception check, you get out of another surprise round.

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:02]** And we're back in combat?

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:04]** You never left combat.

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:06]** We never left combat?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:08]** Never, never, never.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:11]** The real combat is the K'voks you find along the way.

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:13]** There it is.

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:16]** And boom!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:19]** Oh, there are three of them spread out across this yard.

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:20]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:21]** And you can actually see them now.

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:25]** So now there's five of these piles of, you know, miscellaneous parts.

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:26]** Yeah.

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:31]** And you can see that on the first pile closest to you, you've already killed the K'vok that came out of that one.

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:32]** Yeah.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:40]** And Chak has noticed and paid attention that he sees these other ones kind of crawling in and out of the piles.

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:42]** That's so cool.

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:47]** They're basically eating the metal, and so they're burrowing through this metal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:49]** Is there a chance they haven't noticed us yet?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:52]** Since they're chowing down?

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:53]** I don't know.

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:54]** Let me see.

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:56]** No, they don't notice you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:56]** Really?

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:57]** Dope.

**[00:59:58 - 00:59:58]** Okay.

**[00:59:58 - 01:00:00]** Chuck turns to the group.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:02]** So, well, no.

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:04]** We're still in initiative order.

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:06]** Okay.

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:09]** And Rolo just went, so it is now Thaddeus' turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:12]** Can I just say real quick?

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:25]** I think it's just a cool image that really spears it, and then he puts his foot to start to try and pull the spear out, but then the camera pans up, and then three more of them come out in the distance.

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:29]** And so then we're all like, you know, classic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:31]** Yeah, that is pretty cool.

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:33]** A little snapshot.

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:34]** I love that.

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:39]** Is there a way we could figure out their range at which they can sense us?

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:41]** Now that we've battled one, Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:44]** I would say you would have to roll a life science check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:45]** All right, great.

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:45]** That's cool.

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:46]** That's fine.

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:47]** I just wanted to know.

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:52]** It's... Well, if anyone else wants to roll one, by all means.

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:52]** I got a four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:54]** I don't think anybody else is trained in it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:55]** Oh, yeah, that's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:58]** Well, f**k. You think these things are blind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:58 - 01:00:59]** I'm not a biologist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:00]** What do I look like, a doctor?

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:07]** It might be better to pick them off one by one instead of get ambushed by all of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:14]** This is a really hard decision, so I think we should pick them off one by one.

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:21]** We don't want to get swarmed, so I'll take the first shot against that one over yonder.

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:24]** Maybe take it by surprise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:24 - 01:01:28]** He just kind of steps over the body of this dead one and fires a shot at that little guy.

**[01:01:30 - 01:01:34]** So that's 14, which hits.

**[01:01:34 - 01:01:36]** And then that's... Which one?

**[01:01:37 - 01:01:38]** The one dead ahead.

**[01:01:39 - 01:01:39]** Five damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:39 - 01:01:44]** Yeah, so there's one straight ahead because the path kind of... Straight ahead from the perspective of your characters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:46]** This one right here, he's shooting.

**[01:01:48 - 01:02:10]** straight ahead from my southernly most one yeah the path like curves and does u-turn and there's one kind of right in the middle of the u-turn one at the top of the u-turn and one at the bottom and the one at the bottom is straight ahead of us i feel like the one that's like north northwest we could avoid perhaps but this one i don't know if we can sneak by you know what i mean there's nothing in the way it's just a guess anyway that's five damage kevin no bonus effect


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:12]** What did you roll to hit?

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:12]** 14.

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:13]** 14 EAC?

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:14]** 14 hits.

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:15]** Okay, cool.

**[01:02:16 - 01:02:17]** It takes a shot.

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:18]** The carapace kind of pops apart.

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:19]** A piece of carapace pops off.

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:22]** But that thing is still up.

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:23]** You said five points of damage?

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:24]** Five points, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:25]** All right.

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:26]** Thaddeus will also shout out.

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:27]** Thaddeus will also shout out.

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:28]** One more hit could do it.

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:30]** You know, it takes like two hits.

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:31]** I like these guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:32]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:34]** Okay.

**[01:02:34 - 01:02:36]** Jermaine's going to come up.

**[01:02:37 - 01:02:38]** And...

**[01:02:38 - 01:02:46]** Take out his tactical, he already has it out, equipped, and it's one of his forearms, the tactical semi-auto pistol.

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:47]** Nice.

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:50]** I guess I have to like, because there's partial cover, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:50 - 01:02:52]** I was going to say, right now you're in soft cover because you're standing behind Trey.

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:54]** Yeah.

**[01:02:54 - 01:02:55]** Or from behind Thaddeus, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:55 - 01:02:56]** So is that going to add to his EAC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:57 - 01:02:59]** It'll give him plus two for soft cover.


## Speaker_0

**[01:02:59 - 01:03:00]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:03:00 - 01:03:03]** Um, yeah, I'm not going to retcon it.

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:04]** So I'm just going to, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:04 - 01:03:05]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:08]** I'm behind you whips and I'm going to shoot.

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:13]** Try to, I'm going to do a move so I can't do a full tank.

**[01:03:13 - 01:03:14]** Okay.

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:14]** Ooh.

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:15]** Okay.

**[01:03:15 - 01:03:15]** 20.

**[01:03:16 - 01:03:19]** No, I got a 19 plus one.

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:19]** So 20.

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:20]** Okay.

**[01:03:20 - 01:03:20]** Nice.

**[01:03:21 - 01:03:25]** Uh, roll 18, I guess with the well done.

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:25]** Yeah.

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:26]** Well done.

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:27]** Roll for damage.

**[01:03:28 - 01:03:29]** Max damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:30 - 01:03:31]** Maximum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:03:31 - 01:03:32]** He's dead.

**[01:03:32 - 01:03:32]** He's dead.

**[01:03:32 - 01:03:34]** He's got to be dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:34 - 01:03:42]** You actually, when you shoot it with your pistol, it actually hits it hard enough that the carapace explodes, and it knocks over part of the pile.

**[01:03:42 - 01:03:43]** Nice.

**[01:03:43 - 01:03:50]** And so the cameras kind of zoom in, and as this pile starts to fall, the credits start to roll.

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:52]** That's our game.


## Speaker_0

**[01:03:52 - 01:03:52]** Oh!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:54 - 01:03:57]** Come back next week and see what happens to those other two K'Fox.

**[01:03:57 - 01:03:59]** I'm sure they're going to be winners.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:59 - 01:04:00]** Splendid shot to me.

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:02]** Splendid shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:04:03 - 01:04:03]** GG, guys.

**[01:04:04 - 01:04:05]** Nicely done.

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:12]** Thanks for listening, you scallywags.

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:18]** Until next week, drift begones on Distant Stars.
