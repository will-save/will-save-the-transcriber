## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:00:01 - 00:00:12]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:14]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:15]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:16]** Get out.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:20]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:22]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:22 - 00:00:30]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales of the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:33]** Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:00:56 - 00:00:56]** All right.

**[00:01:13 - 00:01:14]** Did it happen?

**[00:01:15 - 00:01:15]** Okay.

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:49]** I wouldn't.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:50]** Not really.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:51]** Kelly's like, no.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:52]** Kelly's just like, I'm not.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:54]** She's like, I was just going to bed.

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:56]** Yeah, that's true.

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:58]** Yeah, to be honest, I fell asleep at like 4 a.m.

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:58]** last night.

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:59]** It was not good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:00]** Oh, dang.

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:02]** That's only an hour before we were going to record, so it's crazy.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:03]** I know.

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:05]** Yeah.

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:06]** Dang.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:19]** silly Kevin I was gonna you know we've been doing this whole like go around the room tell us a bit more about yourselves type thing and I think our fans like to know a little bit who we are and I like to learn a bit about you guys too I don't like to learn about you

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:21]** Well, that's because you already know everything about me, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:22]** No, I don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:23]** I don't want to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:24]** No, Kevin's still in this, too.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:26]** He's in Enigma.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:26]** Am I?

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:27]** Not really.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:29]** Yeah, you are.

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:29]** I'm an open book.

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:31]** It's more interesting.

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:32]** There's only three pages in it.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:35]** It's a paint-by-number book.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:39]** It's a paint-by-number book.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:43]** And it's mostly just the color blue because it's all navy related.

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:45]** It's just two colors.

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:46]** Blue gold.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:46]** Blue gold.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:50]** Is he like a pop-up book?


## Speaker_0

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:50]** That'd be cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:51]** Yeah, you're a pop-up book.

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:54]** I was actually going to go around and try to learn more about your characters.

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:57]** I think that'd be kind of fun.

**[00:02:57 - 00:03:22]** um so i think i was just thinking about like as i was saying this i was like man we should do like uh two truths and a lie for your characters oh my god so hard think about that for like but i do i want to go around now and i want you to tell me just like i mean you guys are pirates in game so like something had to like lead you to be a pirate um so i kind of want to know like

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:34]** You don't have to tell us about what that catalyst was, but if the catalyst didn't happen, if that event didn't occur, where would your character be at this time in their lives?

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:37]** Pirating was not an option.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:41]** Can I also say that I texted you and asked you, is there going to be something here that's plot related?

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:44]** And you were like, no, of course not.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:45]** It's not plot related.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:48]** Is it at all related to the story?

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:50]** It's like, come on.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:51]** You know, that's not related to the story.

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:52]** No.

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:55]** Does your character like cucumber in their sushi rolls?

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:56]** You know, like that kind of stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:58]** Is that the reason they became a pirate?

**[00:03:58 - 00:03:58]** Yes.

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:00]** Yes.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:01]** Thank God someone finally asked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:04]** Access to cucumbers.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:04]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:05]** Anyway, let's start with you.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:06]** No, no, no, no.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:06]** Let's start with Tony.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:07]** It makes sense for Rolly.

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:09]** I feel like Rolly is like a craft.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:11]** Benny got excited.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:13]** Benny got excited about something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:15]** So like, here we go.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:21]** I mean, I think about Rexalites, they're sort of, they've, they've been a secluded, you know, self-sustaining society forever.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:26]** Uh, but very few of them are like properly adventurous when I go see new things.

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:36]** And so I feel like if the crew of this ship had never visited Chuck's planet, he probably would have been like a statesman.


## Speaker_0

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:36]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:46]** One of the few Raxolites that are out and about in society to bring back new technologies and to evangelize Raxolite culture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:51]** I'll have to put up the picture that I made for you that is Chuck.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:53]** But I just picture him now when you say that.

**[00:04:54 - 00:05:00]** Instead of his flower, his orchid open-faced flower being open, it's like folded back almost like it's combed.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:05]** He's in a little suit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:05]** I love it.

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:09]** Now I really want to see statesman check.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:10]** Senator check.

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:12]** Representative check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:14]** I imagine he looks a bit like business suit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:19]** I want to see a picture of him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:25]** I'll post a picture of Jack as he is in this story.

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:31]** Ralu, why don't you tell us a little bit about yourself?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:32]** Okay, fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:32]** Fine.

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:34]** Who wants to go next?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:36]** I guess I'll go...

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:42]** I think Thaddeus, well, Thaddeus would want to have been, he would want to be a chef for sure.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:47]** Like if you look through his like belongings, you'll find like a cute little apron or two.

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:58]** But one thing that he has done just heads up is that he's, for some of the creatures that he's killed, he has used them as pieces of them as ingredients and he's given them to the ship's chef.

**[00:05:59 - 00:05:59]** Just heads up.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:02]** You know this, your characters don't.

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:28]** oh yeah that's good so it's like that he says souffles and stuff yeah is his melee weapon of choice like a butcher's knife no no he's not like it's more like one of those like uh those like spreaders of like uh uh what are they called like like frosting spreaders he prefers to bake more than anything a butternut yeah that's what he takes to battle with him to reminisce the life he could have had


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:30]** I'm going to spread you all over the ground.

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:35]** I just imagine his ears sticking out from a giant chef's hat.

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:38]** Exactly.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:39]** Hello.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:47]** So to me, what life would your witch word have?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:52]** If I weren't a pirate, I would be some sort of other...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:52 - 00:07:19]** low life uh that's awesome i don't know i i imagine that uh termay would be so uh on our ship he is the yeoman chief and he basically does the sort of accounting for the ship and the dividing of the booty and uh he does the laundry if you will yeah yeah yeah he won't drink you


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:21]** That's actually the cooks on a submarine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:21]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:23]** And it's only for the officers.

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:24]** Everybody has to do their laundry themselves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:28]** He does the laundering of things.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:31]** Are we still tallying Navy facts?

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:31]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:33]** They just don't have to do their own laundry, just like you listed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:35]** No, the cooks do it for them.

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:36]** The cooks do the laundry?

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:38]** The cooks do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:39]** Oh, man.

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:46]** So if you were a cook and you wanted to piss off and do some... No comment there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:46]** No comment?

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:47]** No comment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:47 - 00:08:11]** this truly is i'm not a cook but i you've heard stories that's crazy about use of cayenne pepper and undergarment god truly that's horrible yeah i would imagine uh termay would be uh some sort of uh mercantile grifter probably selling wares at swap meets and uh you know

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:31]** doing something maybe a little shady but not too shady he's mostly in he's in it for the numbers he likes the adventure it brings but he he enjoys the spoils of it's good to know so he's definitely like dealing crayons back in high school sorry he's definitely like dealing crayons back in high school


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:36]** Yeah, you know, he's trying to turn a nickel into ten cents.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:39]** Yeah, what color do you want?

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:41]** I love that that metaphor is stuck.

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:44]** Yep.

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:45]** Dealing crayons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:47]** That's good.

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:50]** Sorry to throw this at you, Will, but I'm curious.

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:53]** The Captain.

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:54]** We can go back to episode one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:55]** The captain.

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:55]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:56 - 00:09:05]** I mean, his entire career is being a free captain in a space pirate league.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:07]** So where would he be without that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:19]** So Noirs are like sort of advanced bovine minotaurs who it would be wrong to assume that they're not thoughtful.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:23]** They're very articulate in the sense that they like

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:27]** They can never be lost, for instance, or something like that.

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:28]** I forget.

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:29]** I was reading up on it.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:33]** But I would say... They can never be lost?

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:46]** They have an incredible sense of awareness and navigation and being able to connect the dots between different facets of their perception.

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:46]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:48]** They just know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:47 - 00:10:10]** So I would imagine maybe he might be like, he might still be a like navigator of sorts or like a guide maybe if he was being benevolent, but also, uh, I don't know if he's bent towards evil per se, but you know, if he were so inclined, he might, he might use that to, I don't know, lead people to traps to, to take advantage of them.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:10]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:13]** I'm hearing like bounty hunter live in that.

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:14]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:18]** Not quite a steward, but... Not quite.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:22]** Or you could just be a steward who just immediately goes to be in the special agent.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:26]** Kinda.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:28]** Operating outside the law.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:33]** But I assume he earned a reputation for his...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:55]** piracy and you know hence became a free captain i like it i like that i i love that we got to know just a little bit more about your characters without knowing anything more about your characters so john your plot holes are not destroyed yet not yet that's fine we'll get to that next week with uh two truths and a lie hey do you want me to say anything about relearn it

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:56]** No, no, we're moving on.

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:57]** Forgot all about Rolude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:58]** Really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:59]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:00]** No, no, no.

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:01]** I want to know more about Rolude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:02]** No, that's cool.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:03]** Tell us about Rolude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:15]** So I think that Rolude would probably, if he could not be a pirate, I think he would choose to stay...

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:23]** Safe aboard the Adari as probably like a priest of Talavet.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:33]** Like guarding the Kasathan tradition aboard the Adari and being a steward of the community and leading in that way.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:35]** I think that's what he would do.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:38]** Very simple existence.

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:39]** Yeah.

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:59]** that would be his preference if he could away from a lot of stuff i agree with that to imagine that adari was turned into a statue to kill the captain on the entire ship spoiler spoiler so many spoilers now we should have a spoiler drop right before you said that like spoiler


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:00]** Every time.

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:01]** Every spoiler.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:03]** It's like a hundred people shouting spoiler.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:07]** I do love the idea that Rollo's a painter in it on his own.

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:16]** And much like Bob Ross, I think after he retires from piracy, he's going to start his own television show where he's painting starscapes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:23]** I'm so excited for Rollo's future of painting after years from now and stuff like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:27]** Maybe he'll just have a little Holovid series.

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:29]** He's got little V-logs of him painting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:32]** Instead of happy trees, it's happy clouds?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:33]** That are in the InfoSpirit.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:36]** Yeah, that are happy clouds from the drift.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:38]** Happy drift clouds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:40]** Cool.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:41]** I love it.

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:46]** Well, I think that is a good segue into our game time.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:47]** So let's play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:47]** Shoot.

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:48]** Let's play.

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:51]** You want to give us a little recap?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:51]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:54]** I got that right here somewhere and make sure I'm on the right one.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:58]** So last week, you guys made your way to the car yards.

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:00]** Car yards.

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:02]** You approached the car yards.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:03]** Way far to the car yards.

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:08]** You approached the gate and you found a man selling meat on a stick and some potato chips.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:10]** Who everyone knew was suspicious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:13]** No matter what we rolled, apparently we couldn't confirm it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:16]** You were rightfully skeptical and couldn't figure out why.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:22]** And there was nothing to tell you that he was anything more than a shady sales guy.

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:23]** True that.


## Speaker_0

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:23]** True that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:30]** Did I need to order the chips in order for him to see the break in his armor?

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:32]** Did I need to be like, can I get the chips?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:35]** We need to roll an insight check on that one.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:39]** Yeah, that would have been code that you were a part of his organization.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:41]** Yeah, that I was a true warrior because I like chips.

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:43]** I never said true warriors.

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:44]** That's what I'm saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:47]** Could be another pirate agency.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:48]** Could be the stewards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:52]** Could be somebody else pulling the strings of these true warriors.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:54]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:59]** Maybe there is some other pirate entity funding like the true warriors down here.

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:00]** I don't know.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:03]** How many folds to this conspiracy are there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:04]** This is the fourth.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:05]** At least three.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:06]** At least three.

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:08]** I can't handle it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:09]** Oh, my God.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:09]** I've had enough.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:10]** So many folds.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:11]** It's too many folds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:15]** Because, like, I just want a clear quest.

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:17]** We've only been through, like, two quests.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:19]** I just want to go to Butterscull Ranch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:20]** I just want to go.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:22]** go to Butterscroll Ranch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:26]** For anyone who's played all Mines or all Eyes of a Phandalin or whatever it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:32]** The Lost Mines of Phandelver.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:39]** That was our game before we decided to... That's what we were playing when we decided to make a Starfinder podcast.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:43]** And Kelly's character, I dropped some clues about Butterscroll Ranch several times.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:49]** And every time there was a moment for the party to decide where to go next, Kelly was like, hey, so we could go


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:53]** I've been slowly working on it.

**[00:14:53 - 00:15:01]** I have a pound, a block of butter in a freezer that I've slowly been carving into a skull to give to Kelly for his birthday.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:03]** That's pretty amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:08]** I thought that you were going to say that there was a reference here in Junker's Delight where you pick up an old book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:11]** I'm not very good at making references to things.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:12]** I'm playing strictly as is.

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:15]** Sorry, in the book it's not happening.

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:39]** people on planet don't make a lot of butter yeah anyways uh so you you guys were you were rightfully skeptical to be uh of the guy who's trying to sell you meat yeah um because right when he when you guys walked away from him he pulled out his cell phone and texted somebody that's right saying that there's four pirates or however you describe our characters didn't see that

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:41]** No, no, because you guys were already gone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:44]** Players heard it, though, for some reason.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:45 - 00:16:07]** Yeah, and speaking of that difference between what your player knows and what you know, you guys came up to a stack, several stacks of engines and cores that were kind of organized like objects, and you noticed something moving in there, but you just couldn't roll high enough to determine what was moving in there and if you knew anything more about what that was.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:08]** And you guys tried.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:08]** You definitely tried.

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:12]** And it turns out there were K'foks.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:20]** They feed on the metal within that pile and you guys disturbed them.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:27]** But you guys managed to alert them enough that they all came out, and you took out two of them.

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:39]** And that's where we lead into, is you are now at the entrance to these separate piles of stuff, and two K'Vox are dead, and you can see at least two more in the distance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:41]** Are we still in combat?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:43]** We're still in combat.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:45]** Same initiative order.

**[00:16:45 - 00:17:13]** same initiative order which you have in your but like kelly said though kelly made a note that you know some of them are outside of like you might be able to get away from this we might be able to get away it's okay to walk away it is it is anyone who says otherwise this is a jerk so that's me don't like yeah the this last one we thought i think we probably had to but there's one that's definitely out of line of sight if we yeah i remember that right yeah for sure yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:15]** I recall that indeed.

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:15]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:17]** And with that, we're going to go right back into initiative order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:20]** We're going to go right back into initiative order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:23]** And let me see if I can do this right.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:27]** I got to move you guys to the map.

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:28]** Is that right?

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:30]** Bam.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:32]** You guys see the map?

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:34]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:35]** Can you give me a shift click?

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:36]** What's a shift click?

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:42]** If you hold shift and click as the GM, it'll move everyone's map to where you clicked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:43]** Oh, that's cool.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:44]** I moved the map.

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:46]** Wait, do that again.

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:49]** I'm going to scroll away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:51]** Hold shift and long click.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:53]** On what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:54]** Where you want us to look at.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:55]** Where you want to center.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:57]** Oh, I see what you're saying.

**[00:17:57 - 00:17:58]** I still haven't moved there yet.

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:00]** Did that work?

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:01]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:03]** Shift click.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:05]** Hold shift and hold click.

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:06]** Ah!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:09]** Dang.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:10]** So nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:10]** Wow.

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:10]** That was so cool.

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:12]** That was incredible.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:16]** Just to clarify, it's hold shift and then hold the click, and it zooms everybody.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:17]** Yeah, that's what he said.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:17]** That is awesome.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:19]** No, I heard shift click, and then I just clicked once.

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:20]** It didn't work.

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:21]** That is really cool.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:22]** Does it work for anybody?

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:24]** Like, if you do it on yours, it will drag everybody else there?


## Speaker_0

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:25]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:26]** I think it was only GM saying.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:26]** Nope.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:27]** I think you have to be GM.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:28]** That could potentially.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:29]** Nope.

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:30]** It's only the GM.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:31]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:31]** Cool.

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:33]** This art too, can I just say, it's really cool.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:37]** It's like a certain level of detail where there's just enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:39]** Kev, you just drew such an amazing map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:41]** Wait, Kevin, one of the enemies disappeared.

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:43]** Did you just do that?

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:44]** I'm glad you noticed.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:45]** Oh, Kevin.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:47]** Why don't you roll a perception check?

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:51]** He's going to be like, it's burrows under this pile of trash to another pile of trash and then it's going to show up somehow.

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:53]** Can we all roll perception checks?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:57]** Because you just did it like... Was that on its turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:58 - 00:18:58]** What happened?

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:00]** You guys are asking a whole lot of questions.

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:02]** You just took a token away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:03]** Yeah.

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:03]** Okay.

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:05]** Outside of turn order?

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:06]** Is that like what's going on?

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:08]** No, it's definitely in turn order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:09]** Okay.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:10]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:12]** So, I mean... Okay.

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:12]** And now it's Chalk's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:14]** No.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:14]** No.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:21]** Chalk is going to try to see where that K'vok went.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:22]** Yeah, good call, dog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:23]** Good call, Chalk.

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:24]** Wait, wait, wait.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:25]** Truthfully, can we see that pile?

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:27]** Because there's this huge pile on the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:30]** I'd say that pile in the middle is probably only a couple, it's four feet tall.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:36]** So you saw the K'vok at the top of this six foot tall pile and it disappeared from sight.


## Speaker_0

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:36]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:38]** So maybe it didn't burrow.

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:39]** Maybe it just hopped down behind that other one.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:40]** It's hiding.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:42]** But did it see us, though?

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:44]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:45]** Yes, it saw you.

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:47]** It did at some point, and that's why it's doing this.

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:48]** Okay, got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:52]** They have dark vision up to 60 feet, so yes, it definitely saw you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:54]** Even though dark?

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:56]** We're in the desert, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:56 - 00:20:00]** Which means they see a normal... Oh my gosh, so many questions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:01]** It's just a cover argument.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:02]** Cool.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:07]** I got a... 22 for perception.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:08]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:11]** You saw it disappear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:13]** Okay.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:14]** Sure.

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:16]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:20]** And you know it disappeared in the downward-ish direction, so it's not like it just went poof into nothing.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:21]** Downward direction.

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:23]** Where else would it disappear to?

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:25]** Well, you saw it dig further into the pile.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:26]** Okay.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:27]** That's what I'll say.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:28]** So it's not like it vanished.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:30]** It's not like it did some kind of cloaking ability.

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:32]** It definitely burrowed is what I'll say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:34]** Took like a swan dive and was like, no, I'm hungry.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:36]** Swan dive.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:38]** Awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:39 - 00:21:06]** uh chalk is going to move to here and i'm taking the initiative man um let's see say again chalk just like on the map chalk is in if there's like a u-turn and we're at the the bottom end of the u-turn and jack just rounds the corner by himself just this little rack so he's a brave guy yeah but also kevin looks too happy so i'm concerned but go ahead i don't


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:11]** I'm happy because I'm drinking this fantastic Cotton and Reed dram, all-spice dram.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:14]** So you're getting all... Drammed up.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:15]** Yeah, drammed up here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:16]** It's a bold move.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:19]** I don't even know what a dram is.

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:21]** It's just a stiff drink, isn't it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:25]** It's an old British measurement that we know why we use.

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:27]** So what does Jack do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:30]** He's going to move... Dynamic random access memory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:31]** And...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:35]** I love that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:39]** Oh, can I do that?

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:42]** No, I'm going to save that for later in the series.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:49]** And then I'm just going to look around, see if there are any other bogeys to be seen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:52]** Well, you can definitely see there's one more to the north of this.

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:57]** So the U-shape, just for the listener, is like a C on the left side of our map.

**[00:21:57 - 00:22:04]** And so they came in facing westward and it horseshoes around and the exit is eastward.

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:07]** And the five piles are kind of in that crook.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:10]** And so where you are now, you're on the inside of that sea.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:15]** You can see that there is one more directly north of you in the pile sticking out.

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:18]** But I will say that it did not notice you.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:22]** You can tell it's focused on its food source.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:23]** He's all tiny and stuff.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:25]** Dope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:26]** You didn't even have to roll a stealth for that.

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:28]** These things are just not paying attention.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:29]** Wow.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:30]** At least that one isn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:33]** Do I still have my hunting rifle out?

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:34]** I don't remember.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:37]** Did I take a shot in this battle or not?

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:40]** I think none of us have life science.

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:43]** I'm going to say that I pull out my hunting rifle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:45]** I have life science.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:46]** You do?

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:48]** So you moved...

**[00:22:48 - 00:23:09]** did you have a bonus sorry i always forget the term for it uh bonus attack attack bonus something no to beat base attack bonus plus one because if it is you can change weapons while you move so if it's not at least one you can't yeah that's a whole action to pull you need to look at your class which we haven't said what those are it's a full round action no it'd be a move action


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:12]** Right, so I took one move action to get over there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:16]** Then your second move action would be... Your standard action would be a move action to pull out your rifle.

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:17]** Yeah.

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:18]** Okay.

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:21]** So now you're standing there with a rifle, and that's your new turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:22]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:23]** Cool.

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:26]** Well, let me just do this real quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:27]** I think I'm going to regret that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:30]** And I think at this point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:31]** Pop goes the weasel.

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:32]** Check, guys.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:35]** The fox saw you.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:36]** Of course.

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:37]** A sandworm pops out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:39]** Yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking.

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:41]** And Kevin would do that if he could.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:46]** Too bad sandworms aren't written into this story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:47]** A land submarine comes out.

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:51]** So it is Captain Goldforge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:53]** Kevin's inside of it, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:54]** Yeah, Kevin's inside.

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:55]** He's the captain.

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:55]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:56]** Riding it.

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:58]** What happens, Kev?

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:02]** It is the K'vok's turn at the north side on that north pile.

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:05]** The most north and kind of last pile as you leave the sea.

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:07]** The last defender?

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:09]** Yeah, Chalk watched him.

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:15]** And as Chalk stops and pulls his rifle out, the light must have gleamed off it just right because he noticed you.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:16]** Oh.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:23]** And he or she is going to move up.

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:26]** And let me just confirm their move speed.

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:28]** Because they don't have any intelligence.

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:29]** A thousand.

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:31]** And it gets right next to you.

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:32]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:33]** Dang.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:35]** Why are you guys wow-danging?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:39]** It just went right in front of Jack.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:40]** Super fast.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:44]** Scurries over with all those scorpion legs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:47]** It's going to take an attack on you.

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:50]** I wish that last roll was an attack.

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:52]** Attack on you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:55]** Does a 15 hit your KAC?

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:57]** 15 hits.

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:58]** 15 does hit.

**[00:24:58 - 00:24:59]** Why didn't you tell him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:01]** Just lie.

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:05]** Is this the first hit of the fox?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:07]** This is the first time Chuck will have been hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:08]** Oh, for a chalk.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:08]** Dang.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:12]** And you take only two points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:12]** Okay, good.

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:17]** Then he's like, I'm into resolve.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:23]** It swings at you and it nips at some of the foliage.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:26]** It's a little plant monkey.

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:29]** And that's the end of the K'fok's turn.

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:31]** And that's the end of the round.

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:32]** We're moving into round three.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:36]** So K'fok number one.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:37]** Which was dead.

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:39]** No.

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:39]** Is still dead.

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:40]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:43]** What was that all about?

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:44]** Come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:45]** Let's roll this turn.

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:46]** Go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:48]** There's a necromancer somewhere.

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:51]** Looks like Kev's having some fun with being a GM.

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:54]** Okay.

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:55]** I can move.

**[00:25:56 - 00:26:07]** Rolu is going to, seeing this baddie run up to Chak and prune him, Rolu is going to attack Chak.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:08]** I love it.

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:09]** Attack Chak.

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:10]** Rolu is going to run up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:17]** He's going to punt Chak into the... He's going to kick Chak and then run the other way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:20]** I'm going to say you've got to use a move action to pick up Jack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:22]** No, he's not going to pick up Jack.

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:26]** He is going to stand right back here.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:28]** And you know what?

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:29]** He had his tactical spear.

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:30]** That's how he killed the other one.

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:33]** I was thinking of casting a spell because he was far away.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:38]** But now that he's here, I want to pull focus from Jack because I don't want anything to happen to Jack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:43]** For the record, Jack is a tiny creature, so you can occupy the same square as him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:44]** Ah, that's true.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:46]** Yeah, I'm going to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:48]** Well, but then I block.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:51]** Is it one size larger or two sizes larger?

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:52]** But he has two sizes larger.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:54]** No, but Chak is two sizes smaller than medium.

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:55]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:56 - 00:27:03]** But if I stand in Chak Square, so for the listener, there's like a little slim alley between a pile of junk and the big wall of junk.

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:07]** And it's Chak and then the Kefak right in front of it.

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:11]** So if I stand where Chak is, then I'll be blocking the view for Thaddeus and for Tormadin.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:12]** So I don't want to do that.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:13]** That's all.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:34]** so it's tactically speaking it's like the uh murder hole yeah it's like the uh gaze of thermopoly yeah yeah okay so i'm gonna run up i use my tactical spear and i'm gonna shout for thermopoly remember thermopoly and then i'm gonna roll uh and i attack with my that was just a hallway on the adari

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:54]** yeah uh okay roll the three not a good start probably skid it in i tried to slam down with the spear and then i like hit some of the junk it just didn't work didn't work but trying to pull focus from this effect or from check


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:55]** That's my turn.

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:56]** All right.

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:59]** And now it is Thaddeus' turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:04]** So Thaddeus just tells the group, he's like, it's important to communicate during combat.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:08]** I, for example, am out of shots in my rifle and have to reload.

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:09]** Heads up.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:11]** And then he's got to spend his time.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:14]** It's like teaching as it goes.

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:15]** That's amazing.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:16]** That's it.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:17]** He's going to reload.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:18]** That was all six seconds.

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:26]** He's also going to roll perception just to see if that other Catholic shows up somewhere nearby somehow.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:27]** Yeah.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:27]** And that's a 21.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:28]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:32]** You do not see anything notable.

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:33]** No.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:35]** So the reload is a standard action?

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:39]** I believe it's... I think it's a move.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:40]** Sorry.

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:41]** Or a move action?

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:42]** I think it's a move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:43]** Yeah, I believe so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:48]** So with, I'm just letting you know, like with that, you could still move and attack.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:52]** I think attack would be hard because you don't have a clear shot, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:55]** I feel like you have, he probably has cover, right?

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:58]** The creature has cover, like soft cover.

**[00:28:58 - 00:28:58]** No, no, no.

**[00:28:58 - 00:29:00]** I think it's probably partial.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:01]** Partial?

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:02]** Okay.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:03]** Not full cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:04]** What do you think, Kevin?

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:06]** So I've reloaded.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:08]** And Kevin, what kind of cover does he have?

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:10]** I'll say it's partial.

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:12]** Okay, cool.

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:13]** And nice.

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:15]** So that's a minus what to attack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:18]** Maybe a plus four to their AC, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:48]** uh no i think it's plus two ac plus two soft cover it affects their damage not like if they hit is what you're saying your bonuses from cover are reduced to plus two ac and plus one to reflex saving throws for partial cover say again yep plus two to ac plus one to oh so is soft cover four then i always soft cover is plus four but no bonus to reflex save yeah okay yep all right so it's a plus two okay well it's seven to their ac so you'll if if their ac was 16 before it's now 18


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:50]** Well, hopefully it wasn't either of those.

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:53]** Because now I rolled a 17.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:55]** Does that hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:56]** You rolled a 17?

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:56]** Wow.

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:57]** Dang.

**[00:29:58 - 00:29:59]** That hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:00]** All right.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:00]** Wow.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:04]** This is a standard round that I will now be hitting you with.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:05]** Just heads up.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:07]** And so no poison this time.

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:11]** But we are looking at 1d8.

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:13]** So here we go.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:14]** Knock him out the box.

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:16]** Eight damage.

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:17]** Congratulations.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:17]** Eight?

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:18]** Damn it.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:19]** You hit the lottery.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:19]** Nice.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:21]** Congratulations.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:21]** Bingo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:23]** And this thing's a dart, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:24]** Yeah, it's a dart.

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:26]** But there's no status effect for this.

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:27]** Yeah, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:35]** You're kind of like leaning around this corner of the pile of the wall of junk that makes the inside of the sea.

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:44]** And I see that you just kind of lean out just enough and you get your eye on it and you pull that trigger and this dart pierces right through the eye.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:48]** You see it burst out the back of the character.

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:49]** So satisfying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:51]** Amazing.

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:55]** And this kapok freezes into place and falls over.

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:55]** Oh!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:58]** Dude, Thaddeus loves the way you described that.

**[00:30:59 - 00:30:59]** Thank you.

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:00]** Nice.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:00]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:02]** Kelly loves it.

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:06]** Well done, whips.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:14]** I think Rolu looks over and gives you a scowl because he tried to kill it, and you did right afterwards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:16]** Jack shakes his leaves to get the viscera off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:17]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:20]** Two points of damage.

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:21]** Too slow, Rolu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:22]** Are we still in initiative?

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:23]** That's what I was going to ask.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:26]** Yeah, I'm going to say you're still in initiative.

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:27]** What?

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:27]** What?

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:29]** It is now Treme's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:33]** I'm going to scout ahead.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:35]** Cover me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:36]** Be careful.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:37]** I've got your back.

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:40]** Termay's going to walk up 30 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:42]** Pretty sure there's a kafak over there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:45]** Can I perceive anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:54]** With that, oh, you don't need to perceive anything because as you pass it, the kafak pulls out of the ground and gets an attack of opportunity on you.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:54]** What?

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:55]** Where?

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:55]** Oh, hello.

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:56]** Hold on.

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:58]** I got to switch over to the other...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:58 - 00:32:05]** I wish that instead of attacks of opportunity, there was insults of opportunity or compliments of opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:08]** You always have an opportunity to speak.

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:13]** So I wasn't going to do it to you, but you did pass through this square here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:14]** Oh, that's fine.

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:17]** I'm going to use... Can I use block?

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:20]** Would you be in that square then when he makes the AOL?

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:21]** I think you would.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:22]** Okay.

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:24]** Oh, you're saying it would stop his movement?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:25]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:25]** I forget.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:27]** I would think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:28]** Wait, what are you going to say about block?

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:30]** Is it because you have your spear out or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:31]** I have a battle staff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:33]** Nice.

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:34]** So what are the rules on blocking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:42]** Melee weapons can have the block special property, which represents some kind of guard or crossbar that can protect you from attacks by a foe.

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:45]** You strike in melee when you successfully strike.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:47]** Okay, so I have to strike him first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:50]** Let's hope you can use the...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:50 - 00:33:14]** fuck block oh man and i'm pretty sure a seven does not hit no so you are you're walking past the first pile and you come around that corner and you think you're keeping clear and all of a sudden the dirt kind of uh flakes up out of the ground and this thing reaches up and just almost like a cat from uh underneath that blanket scoops at your leg and this is

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:18]** No, it's a vicious.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:20]** It's a vicious.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:21]** Hello?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:24]** So I'm going to try to hit it.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:24]** It's Dice Cam.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:26]** With the staff now.

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:27]** Dice Cam!

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:27]** Hey, Dice Cam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:29]** Dice Cam, I didn't know you'd be on this show.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:30]** Hey, guys.

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:32]** It's got like a digital camouflage look.

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:33]** It's great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:36]** Does a 12 hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:37]** Oh.

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:39]** 12 is right on the money.

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:41]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:42]** So yes, it does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:43]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:45]** A tie goes to the attacker?

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:46]** Is that how it goes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:48]** What do you say, Vinny?

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:49]** Tie goes to the roller?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:49 - 00:34:12]** tie goes to the roller tie goes to the roller boom all right here we go here we go all right okay okay okay uh two points of damage all right nice points of damage let me mark that down oh i never killed the other one sorry hold on a second another one of these foul creatures is over here

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:13]** So you did two points of damage.

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:16]** No, the other one I was talking about is the one that you guys just killed a second ago.

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:17]** Oh, you didn't kill it.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:19]** I didn't mark it on my Excel sheet that I'm using.

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:22]** All right.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:23]** So that was the end of Treme's turn.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:31]** And now the Kafak is actually going to do a full attack on you since you were closest.

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:36]** So that's going to be minus four to hit for each of these attacks.

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:38]** I rolled a 17 on the first one.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:40]** I'm just reading off the die.

**[00:34:40 - 00:35:09]** does that mean it's 17 total or 17 total 17 total okay okay and then uh sevens for the second one so it's you hit once yeah so it popped up it it missed you that first time you swung at it and then it just latches onto your leg with with a claw uh and then tries to strike again and misses on the third strike um and that is going to be 1d6 of damage wait it like wait just clarify does it latches you're right that was that's okay there's that's a six on the die

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:11]** for six points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:12]** Okay.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:13]** I'm into hit points.

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:14]** Deep into hit points.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:16]** This was a mistake.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:19]** You didn't know this would happen.

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:21]** And that's the end of the K'Fox turn.

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:23]** Chuck, it is now your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:35]** Chalk is going to, because he's tiny, he has heard but not seen the attack on Joms.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:41]** So he's going to climb up onto Cobb's shoulder and level his rifle at the Kvark.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:42]** Nice.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:42]** All right.

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:49]** So I said that's low cover there, and you're now six feet high.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:51]** So I think I'm going to give that to you.

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:52]** That's a clean shot, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:53]** I'd say so.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:54]** You have the high ground?

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:55]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:58]** And these things are medium creatures, so it's probably four or five feet tall.

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:00]** So yeah, you got a clean shot on that.

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:01]** Love it.

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:01]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:04]** Here goes nothing.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:06]** I'm going to roll a die.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:08]** It's a three.


## Speaker_0

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:10]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:13]** It's a three plus two.

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:14]** It's a five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:16]** Ooh, that's so close.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:18]** Wow, that's wild.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:19]** So close, man.

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:20]** But you miss.

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:23]** Oh my goodness.

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:25]** I'm just going to assume that misses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:27]** And that's your move and your action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:29]** That's my move and my action, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:32]** So we're going to go to round four, and it is now Rolu's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:33]** Wow.

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:33]** All right.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:36]** Well, I think Chak ran up.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:37]** Wait, where is Chak again?

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:38]** On your shoulder.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:39]** He's on your shoulder.

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:40]** That's right.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:40]** Okay.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:44]** Rolu silently laments that he can't punt Chak across the yard.

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:54]** So instead, he's going to turn, and I think he is going to... Tormadin, you said that you were deep into hit points now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:55]** I am, yes.

**[00:36:56 - 00:37:01]** I know what I'm doing next turn, which is a guarded step.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:03]** That's fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:09]** I think in the mean... Now the creature knows what you're going to do, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:11]** Duh!

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:14]** I'm trying to decide if I want to either... I didn't think the fox had intelligence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:17]** They're mindless, but not thoughtless.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:21]** So it understands.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:21]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:23]** Way into this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:30]** Rulu's deciding if he wants to either restore your hit points, so that way you have more, or step in and try and take out this creature.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:33]** Feel like...

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:38]** Rulu probably knows you're deep into your hit points, so you can go down.

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:39]** So this is not so good.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:46]** So I think the first thing Rulu is going to do is cast Blessings of Youth on you, Tormadin, to restore your hit points.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:46]** Thank you.

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:48]** That is a smart move.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:49]** What does it do?

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:52]** It is a D8 of stamina points.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:58]** And then also you get a plus five enhancement bonus to your land speed for one round.

**[00:37:59 - 00:37:59]** So for round four.

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:03]** But to stamina, not health.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:03]** Correct.

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:04]** Not health.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:05]** We talked about that.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:05]** Oh!

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:07]** Full stamina points.

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:08]** You get eight stamina points back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:12]** I only get five, but yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:13]** Amazing.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:14]** You're at five stamina points.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:15]** I'm at five now.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:16]** You're at full stamina.

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:17]** Okay, cool.

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:20]** That was his turn, and then I'm also going to take a step over.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:31]** Then I'm going to step up next to the Tormadin so that way I can be... Actually, I'm going to pass through a square and come over to here so I'm not blocking a shot.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:58]** and i hopefully i can pull focus uh that oh that would occur you know what i'm gonna try and do that what i need to roll twice because i need to move into his square and then out of his square you're gonna try to do what well because i or something well because i want to so i want to take a five foot step and be on the right side of tornado and then i want to get to the other side is that two aos because i have to move into his square that's if it's a guarded step it wouldn't be an ao but then that would be my hope but i used a spell though which is a standard action


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:58 - 00:39:09]** Yeah, so you can move, do a straight move through an attack of opportunity, or you do a guarded step around Termanin, which would be behind him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:12]** You can move behind me.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:14]** You can move to this square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:16]** Yeah, you'd be right next to him because that's a five foot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:20]** Can I do like acrobatics and try and get through without incurring an AOA?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:25]** I don't know the rules on acrobatics, but if you had to go through two squares, because you'd be in one.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:25]** No, no, no.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:27]** He can go around, though.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:27]** Oh, that's true.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:29]** He has enough movement to go around.

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:30]** Yeah, that's true.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:31]** Okay, way to make it simple.

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:32]** Gosh.

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:33]** Yeah, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:37]** Well, I want to make it cool and try and do that, but I'll do that later.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:46]** Yeah, so I'm going to move around, Tormadin, and squeeze behind you, hopefully leaving a shot open for Thaddeus, and also maybe the Kefak will want to attack me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:47]** Cool, cool, cool.

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:48]** Okay, so that's Rolu's turn.

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:59]** Question, and this is kind of like jumping ahead in initiative order though, is Chuck, are you going to stay on his shoulder or are you going to use your move action separately?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:02]** I'm using my move action from my next turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:04]** I think so.

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:06]** It kind of makes it confusing when Rolu goes ahead of you.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:07]** It made a lot of sense when he didn't.

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:10]** So I guess we've got to house rules that somehow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:14]** I'm good with mortgaging my move action to stay on his shoulder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:14]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:16]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:17]** Yeah, that makes sense.

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:27]** You're using sort of force to like maintain inertial, you know.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:28]** I love it.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:28]** I don't know.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:29]** You're the physicist.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:30]** I mean, engineer.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:31]** You guys know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:32]** I like it.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:33]** I think it's a good rule.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:33]** Yeah.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:43]** If you're going to be on someone's shoulder, then to stay with them, it's either move action to stay with them from your next turn or you jump off and use your move action separately.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:45]** And I'll say there's no penalty for jumping off.

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:48]** Cool.

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:48]** All right.

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:50]** So it is Thaddeus' turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:52]** I think that could be spammed.

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:54]** I would say half speed to jump off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:56]** Okay.

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:57]** All right.

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:57]** Cool.

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:58]** Somebody should be marking this down somewhere.

**[00:40:58 - 00:41:00]** I feel this is going to come up in the future.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:02]** No, this goes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:03]** Kali, please mark that down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:08]** The person that should not be doing this is me.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:09]** Let's see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:10]** What was the house rule?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:11]** Are the notes open?

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:14]** Do we have a house rules sheet?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:16]** I think it's on the same sheet as our rules.

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:17]** We'll find it later.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:18]** Just make a note somewhere.

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:33]** If you're quote unquote mounted on somebody else's shoulder and they move, it is half speed once you leave or to jump off and then have your own movement or you spend your entire move to stay on their shoulder during the movement.

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:36]** As complicated, we work on the wording later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:38]** Okay, okay, hold on.

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:44]** So if you mount it on someone else's shoulder, they move at half speed if they're getting off their shoulder and then moving again?

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:46]** Is that what you're saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:52]** Yeah, if the character, the mount moves, then you can choose to stay in your location, but you can only move half speed from there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:52 - 00:42:01]** Does that mean, though, that... That's interesting, because it's kind of a cool hack, because if somebody has stellar movement...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:02]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:04]** Well, you're just holding on at that point.

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:05]** You're just going to move action and hold on.

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:07]** I think it's good.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:10]** We'll talk to the rules lawyers about this and see if there's any clarifications.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:11]** All right.

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:13]** And it's a full move action to just stay on their shoulder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:14]** Is that right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:17]** It's a move action to stay with them during the movement.

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:21]** And then if not, you stay in location from the previous location.

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:24]** And then it's a half move after that.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:24]** All right.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:25]** Thank you.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:25]** Cool.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:26]** All right.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:29]** And then whenever you're done with typing that out, it's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:30]** I'll format it, Kelly.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:30]** Go ahead.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:31]** All right.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:31]** Thank you.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:38]** Thaddeus moves up into diagonal range of this animal.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:40]** And then he's going to attack.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:42]** That's a 23 to hit.

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:43]** I'm assuming that does.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:44]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:48]** I was going to say, there might be some cover there just because of that pile.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:49]** Okay.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:50]** Well, I'm pretty sure it's going to be fine.

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:51]** But 23 still hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:53]** Seven damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:55]** Dang!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:57]** And you are just stellar today.

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:57]** Wow.

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:57]** Step over.

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:58]** Stellar.

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:00]** Take a shot.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:04]** And this time the dart hits it right in the forehead.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:07]** But you see the dart just vanish into the skull.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:10]** And this thing falls forward.

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:10]** Yes!

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:12]** Hits the ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:13]** I love your death descriptions.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:16]** Chex still somehow gets splattered by viscera.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:19]** Yeah, he's the only one.

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:20]** It goes right over Rolu's shoulder.

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:23]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:27]** Get this creature off of my cloak.

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:28]** That's the end of combat.

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:29]** That's the end of combat.

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:31]** I think Rolu turns and looks at Thaddeus.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:41]** And says, great shot, Thaddeus, but it should be noted that you were only able to make that because I moved out of the way for you.

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:43]** Gave you an opening, if you will.

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:46]** But good shot, nonetheless.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:51]** Say whatever you want yourself to make you feel better, Cobb.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:52]** Well done, everyone.

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:54]** Great combat.

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:56]** Let's make sure there's no more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:55 - 00:44:04]** Quick question is, do you guys want to do anything else in this area with the piles or the bodies of these K'voks?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:06]** Yeah, they're goodies on the bodies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:09]** Yeah, I wanted to do, should we do investigation or perception?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:12]** Or can we just, I mean, they're like creatures, I assume.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:16]** I'll say they don't have any items on them.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:16]** Yes.

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:19]** But if you do a life science check, I can give you something.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:21]** A life science, interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:24]** What skill would it be to field dress these dudes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:27]** That would be life science.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:28]** I'm thinking hunting.

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:30]** Life science would make sense too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:33]** I'll give you survival, but I'm going to bump up the DC on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:34 - 00:45:04]** if you do so rolo doesn't have a great survival i don't either jack has a zero survival but i feel like he's ambitious enough to try it is anyone trained in life science didn't you say thaddeus yeah yeah i feel like you should do so many things also thaddeus is already disclosed privately that uh not to our characters but that uh he likes to cut up his corpses and feed them to us yeah yes we yes that's right the worst meat pies in london

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:07]** Yep.

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:11]** So it would make sense that he would carve up these corpses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:12]** No, this is true.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:14]** This is actually why Thaddeus has high life science.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:15]** Well, A life science.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:16]** But it's 16.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:17]** That is enough.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:24]** So you know that these creatures have exoskeletons that can be refined for various uses.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:32]** And within hours of a fox death, the internal connective tissues actually dissolve away into a mush and makes them really easy to clean out.

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:38]** So they're not edible unless you get to the meat inside of them and give it to the guy out front that's trying to sell you crappy meat.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:42]** But you can clean up these carapaces each for 25 credits.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:43]** Total?

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:44]** Each.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:45]** Each one is 25 credits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:46]** Wow.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:47]** How many bulk are they?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:49]** That's 100 credits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:50]** How bulky are they?

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:55]** Combine their half bulk.

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:56]** Oh, dope.

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:58]** As I roll my eyes because I have no idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:00]** It's cool.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:03]** Don't tell us you have no idea or else we wouldn't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:04]** Edit that part out.

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:05]** Nope.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:06]** I know that exactly.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:07]** That's...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:07]** Cool.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:10]** Might be worth to keep these carcasses then, it seems like.

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:13]** Is that what I'm seeing, Thaddeus?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:16]** You can get a pretty penny for them.

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:20]** They could be useful for different things.

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:21]** I'll help carve them up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:22]** Cool.

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:26]** So you guys take some time, clean them up, pack them away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:30]** I think Rolo's going to just stroll around, try and get a sense of

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:33]** What did we figure out that these piles were?

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:36]** They were engines, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:44]** They're like components of ships and vehicles that are organized into piles.

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:51]** So one of them is all catalytic converters, and another one is all transmissions, and another one is power cores, and so on and so forth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:54]** Can I just do a perception around just to see what else there is?

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:59]** Looking for any like discarded items that maybe don't belong, thinking maybe any footprints.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:02]** Well, sorry, you said there were a lot of footprints last time.

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:08]** Anything that could give us a clue as to maybe some of the other people who pass through here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:31]** uh i think it's a little tricky for this situation even if you did have a role i'd feel like you it's not like you know what boots are assigned to the you know everybody so you even if you found footprints i don't think they'd be right you would know they were bipeds is there anything like on the ground that is that is here that is like new and it's like that doesn't belong in this junkyard

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:35]** Yeah, I'm going to say no, not really.

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:35]** I'm just kicking rocks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:38]** All right.

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:39]** Do you get a thought, Vinny?

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:40]** It's a funny joke.

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:44]** He's kicking rocks, which is a military term for like running away.

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:45]** Kick rocks.

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:46]** Go away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:47]** Well, it's just like waiting around.

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:48]** You just kick rocks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:48 - 00:48:00]** Thaddeus, after having helped carve up some of these bugs, he's going to kind of stand over one and say to Torme, Torme, can you help me with this?

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:07]** And then Torme hopefully will come over and Thaddeus will have a brief conversation with him.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:07]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:13]** Wait, before you do this, do you want Jon and Vinny to take off their headphones?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:17]** They don't have to take off their headphones, but...

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:42]** thaddeus is not going to speak unless he's sure he's not going to be heard by the other two cool so i know that they're close so he's going to try to be like say this in a low tone of voice you know what i'm saying i'm going to turn my i don't know if i have to roll for that signal yeah what'd you say same i'm gonna you don't have to choose choosing to take their headphones it would be it's not necessary like i thank you i appreciate that but you already know some things

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:44]** So he just kind of like whispers to Tremayden.

**[00:48:44 - 00:49:02]** He's like, Tremayden, I've gotten some interesting news and I would appreciate if you could access the logs of the ship and scrape all communications between Rolu and any outside parties.

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:05]** And when you're done, please present them to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:09]** I will do my best.

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:16]** However, may I inquire as to the nature of this query?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:30]** I'm afraid I can't say yet, but I promise you that depending on what you find, I'll share some information with you if my suspicions are confirmed.

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:34]** No, nothing super alarming right now.

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:35]** Just as soon as possible, please.

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:36]** All right.

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:38]** Thank you to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:42]** Wow.

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:44]** Welcome back, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:57]** I think it's during, while this is happening, Rolu has probably been just walking around the perimeter and probably trying to think about, I think he's trying to piece together what's going on here.

**[00:49:57 - 00:50:08]** And he's also a little lost in his thoughts because he's a little bit letting himself get carried away a little bit, thinking about how he could paint this little bend where he's in.

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:21]** and it's but it's but it's it's not because he's lazy it's because he's just like he's just trying to recognize a moment when he sees it and trying to remember it if he can store it in his memory


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:43]** interesting um check is like when you have kids and they find your toolbox they just find random uh unrelated items and try to smash them together to make it work he's doing that with the gack and also just like trying to make himself comfortable in this big bed of stuff roll roll an engineering check for me

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:45]** Is engineering trained?

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:46]** I think so.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:46]** I think it is.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:47]** I can roll one.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:50]** I mean, I could roll a D20, but I got nothing.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:50]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:52]** Okay.

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:57]** I was going to say, if you had engineering and you rolled high enough, I'd be like, oh, you just made some kind of... Can I roll an engineering to see what he made?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:58 - 00:50:58]** Jack made a mess.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:03]** I love it.

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:04]** I love it.

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:04]** All right, cool.

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:07]** So where do you guys go next?

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:08]** Kind of an easy question, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:10]** Yeah, I think we follow the ravine.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:11]** Yep.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:12]** Follow the bend.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:21]** So you guys wrap around the sea and you go, you follow the cavern kind of further in and you come to a wall and there's kind of only two ways to go from there.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:26]** It's to the right, to the left, or I guess the third way would be right back behind you, which...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:54]** is the entrance so which way do you choose to go and do you guys want to roll anything to see if there's any information which is not much um i want to roll a survival check to see if there are like more footprints or more fresh tracks in a given direction okay go ahead roll it let's see what we get ocho eight eight uh i'll also roll yeah a roll


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:56]** Can you aid in survival?

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:57]** Please roll.

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:58]** Eight sucks.

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:01]** Fourteen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:03]** Bro, Luke got a 17.

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:05]** To me, I didn't get a natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:06]** Dang!

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:07]** Nice.

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:09]** All right, I'll tell you as it is.

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:13]** You see tons of footprints going every which way and directions.

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:16]** Lots of skittering weird shapes and stuff that you think are just wild animals.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:18]** Probably most like a fox.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:22]** But the freshest prints you see are a group.

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:23]** And I'm just going to say that.

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:24]** A group of footprints.

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:27]** And you see them kind of leaning off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:30]** Leading off where?

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:31]** To the right or to the left?

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:32]** To the north or to the east?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:34]** I didn't write the Sims.

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:37]** Pick a hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:38]** Left.

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:39]** Your left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:40]** Our right.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:41]** They go to the right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:42]** They go to the right.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:42]** They go to the right.

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:44]** What sort of footprints are they?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:49]** They are some kind of bipedals.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:52]** They're shoes and boots.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:55]** How spaced are they?

**[00:52:55 - 00:53:01]** Are they standard two and a half, three feet per person?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:04]** Like, could you see the difference between a run versus a walk?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:05]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:07]** Yeah, they all look like they're walking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:08]** Okay.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:09]** Are there any drag tracks?

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:15]** And they're all uniform as, like, footprints as far as depth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:19]** Okay, I'm going to correct one thing here because you did roll high enough.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:25]** You do notice that there is one set of tracks that is a little bit deeper.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:27]** and a little more spread out.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:31]** And if you look close enough, they're heading in the opposite direction.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:36]** But the rest of them are moving inward at a steady pace to the right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:37]** And there's a lot.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:41]** So lots of tracks moving to the right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:51]** The search party went to this right side, and perhaps someone carrying at a heavy, heightened pace went north.

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:53]** Good observation.

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:56]** Is that a correct assessment, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:58 - 00:54:07]** I'm going to say the majority of them are going off towards the right, and there is one set of tracks that is different and heading in a different direction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:10]** It's wider spaced.

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:11]** Yeah.

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:13]** So they were running, perhaps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:15]** Stay jogged.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:16]** Yeah.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:16]** Sprinting.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:17]** Hard to say.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:19]** Cobb, what say ye?

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:20]** Left or right?

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:22]** So here's your choice.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:25]** Are you going to go to the right or are you going to move to the left?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:26]** Cobb, what say ye?

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:28]** It's tough from a metagame perspective.

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:29]** I think we go to the right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:31]** Let's do it from an in-game perspective.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:31]** Yeah.

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:36]** In-game perspective, so we're looking for a single person, right?

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:36]** Correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:47]** You're looking for, just to recall what's going on, you're looking for a single person, but that person was also being guided by... A group.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:50]** The last guide from Riddle.

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:58]** So she has a hired guide named Morgan, and he was guiding an android into the car guards.

**[00:54:58 - 00:55:00]** So you're looking for two people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:00]** Yeah.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:06]** Yeah, it seems odd that one set of tracks goes to the north because that would mean that somebody split off.

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:09]** And it feels like... Yeah.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:14]** It feels like the right is definitely the main quest and the left is the...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:18]** Let's go right, shall we?

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:20]** I think it could be worth it.

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:24]** I'm just nervous about how narrow this path leads.

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:27]** Sets up for an ambush by a group.

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:32]** However, the only way out of an ambush is to set it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:37]** Let's roll perception on these piles real quick, Kevu.

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:40]** Just a 10 for me, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:46]** Yeah, we see these long, like, tendon-like piles that are kind of coming up out of the ground at the bottom, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:53]** I just moved to very close to the wall, and I can see up here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:54]** Can I, like, see anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:58]** Yeah, that's what... Roll perception, and I'll let you know what you can see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:58 - 00:56:02]** That's what Rolo was going to say, was we should at least look around this northern corner and see what there is.

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:03]** Got an 18.

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:05]** Oh, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:07]** I got a...

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:10]** Sorry, what is my perception?

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:10]** Bonus.

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:11]** Oh, no.

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:11]** 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:13]** Okay.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:22]** So I'll say from where you're standing, Treme, you don't notice a whole lot unless you're going to move further in.

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:27]** So if you were standing like here-ish, then I would be able to tell you more.

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:33]** And then for this direction, who was looking to the right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:35]** Thaddeus?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:37]** Thaddeus, what did you roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:41]** Well, I only rolled a 10, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:44]** So you see a pile of stuff.

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:46]** Okay, so you're saying you moved up to, say, here?

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:47]** I'll give it to you if you move forward.

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:49]** Yeah, I guess I should move forward for what I did there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:54]** I think we should commit and search and see where this lone individual went.

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:55]** How do we feel?

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:56]** That's fine.

**[00:56:57 - 00:56:58]** I guess Cobble.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:00]** I guess...

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:25]** i mean are we going north i don't i mean i'm fine to go the other way i just wanted to see what was around this corner and if this like was a big sheet of metal for like signage or whatever brother's gonna walk up behind y'all i'll say you did you see no signage but unless you go further in i'm not gonna explain to you what's over there it looks like a boss fight like in a video game like a giant thing of tires i'm just saying it looks like an arena for that so heads up or i've been playing too much elden ring but here we go


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:36]** Okay, so from where Thaddeus is standing, I will tell you that the path opens up and it widens to form a clearing with a massive mound of discarded tires and rubber at its center.

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:37]** It looks like a boss fight.

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:47]** Many of these tires are ripped to shreds, leaving only strips of treated rubber, and there's a pudgent smell of rotting rubber that hangs in the air.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:48]** It's too suspicious.

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:56]** Thaddeus, in his knowledge of combat, will say, I think we should be ready to engage if we go this direction.

**[00:57:57 - 00:57:59]** Perhaps then we should avoid it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:59 - 00:57:59]** I agree.

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:07]** I think it could be useful to come back later as it might hold some answers that we might not find in the other direction.

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:09]** Should we head south?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:20]** Well, it seems like this southern corridor turns north also because metagame has not any other direction to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:24]** Perhaps we will circle back to that area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:31]** Just for the listener, it's kind of like this diagonal, almost like reverse S shape that is dividing this section.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:37]** So it does look like both areas kind of wrap around to at least other areas.

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:50]** But when you start heading to, I'm going to call it the right, but it's actually more like the southeast, you see nothing but fenders and side panels that have been stacked up neatly along this narrow path to form something akin to like a canyon.

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:50]** Yeah.

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:55]** The air in this area is very still and musty almost.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:57 - 00:58:59]** Do you see anything, Shock?

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:00]** Found the moisture farmers, did we?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:03]** Or the lack thereof.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:08]** I think Rillo's going to start to walk ahead and roll perception.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:12]** He's going to take five foot step in next to this first mound.

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:14]** If that's cool with you, Kivv.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:24]** I feel like we should... So Perception's going to tell you that these are fenders and side panels stacked up neatly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:26]** So 13, okay.

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:28]** But I don't see any movement or anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:30]** You don't notice any movement.

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:31]** Why don't you give me an engineering check?

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:32]** Does anybody have an engineering?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:33]** I do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:34]** Okay, roll an engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:35]** Does anybody else have it?

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:36]** You want to roll or aid?

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:37]** No, I don't.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:39]** I did not roll well.

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:40]** I got a 13 total, so...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:43]** I'm not trained in engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:44]** Just me.

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:45]** That's your job, Kyle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:48]** You're close, but I can't give it to you.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:52]** I've got a computer store.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:52]** Dang it.

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:58]** Maybe these are just parts that I would recognize what they're used for, but I don't know their model.

**[00:59:58 - 01:00:01]** I just can't put anything together.

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:03]** I'm still thinking about painting, maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:07]** Does anyone else want to roll anything, or do you guys just want to chance it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:08]** Is there like a culture?

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:11]** Is there any writing on these parts?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:18]** No writing unless you want to start looking into, you know, some of them say Ringworks, some of them say Avidar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:20]** Oh, I know what happens.

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:23]** I get a little notification on my device.

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:24]** I look at it.

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:25]** Turns out my laundry's ready.

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:27]** But then I look back.

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:31]** Weps, I'm sorry, uh, your laundry seems to be delayed again.

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:32]** I'm so sorry about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:34]** The cook's just informed me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:38]** The cook's just let me know that it won't be ready by the time that we get back.

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:40]** Dearest apologies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:44]** Daddy's just perplexed.

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:48]** I guess, like, I guess, like, he thinks, like, Rolly's, like, trying to neg him in some small way.

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:52]** He just, like, brushes an ear, like, ignores him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:54]** Do we keep moving in?

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:54]** Yeah.

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:56]** Okay.

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:56]** Yeah.

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:57]** Here we go.

**[01:00:57 - 01:00:59]** We're always going to take 10 feet.

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:00]** Here goes nothing.

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:04]** I think we're all just going to move slowly until Kev tells us to stop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:07]** I would say about halfway around.

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:10]** Again, this time it's like a reverse C shape.

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:13]** And there's kind of two columns that's kind of divided in the middle by a pile.

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:17]** But as you're passing through, it's almost very beautiful.

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:23]** It's almost like the sand caves in Arizona where they're layered in a certain way.

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:27]** And as you're passing through, that air is stagnant and it's silent.

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:29]** Nothing is moving.

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:30]** And you don't hear anything.

**[01:01:31 - 01:01:36]** And I'll give you one more chance to roll a perception slash engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:38]** 15 for perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:41]** 23 for engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:42]** Perfect.

**[01:01:43 - 01:01:48]** And so now that you get a closer look at these things, you can actually see that time and pressure have fused these chassis parts together.

**[01:01:48 - 01:01:49]** That's cool.

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:52]** And it would take a large explosion or a huge amount of acid to stabilize them.

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:53]** That's so cool.

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:56]** And there's your comfort here.

**[01:01:56 - 01:02:01]** So you guys make your way around this circle, and there's no movement, and it feels perfectly safe.

**[01:02:02 - 01:02:06]** And as you come out, go ahead and move somebody up here.

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:08]** Can I do—I can't move you.

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:08]** Cool.

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:14]** And as you come around that corner, you see kind of an opening where there's two areas kind of combining.

**[01:02:14 - 01:02:17]** And from where you're standing, you can see that there is at least one body.

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:18]** What?

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:20]** Laying in the middle of this field.

**[01:02:20 - 01:02:21]** Ready to go splat?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:23]** And that's our game.

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:24]** Oh!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:25]** Cam!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:26]** Cam!

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:28]** What a hook.

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:31]** What a hook.

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:32]** How could you do that to us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:35]** Murder, mystery, intrigue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:36]** Intrigue.

**[01:02:37 - 01:02:40]** Unknown treasures.

**[01:02:40 - 01:02:46]** Next to the body is just a shit part that says the Star Dream 2 or the Chimera.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:52 - 01:02:55]** Thanks for listening, you scallywags.

**[01:02:55 - 01:03:00]** Until next week, drift begones on Distant Stars.
