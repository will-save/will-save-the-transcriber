## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:00:01 - 00:00:12]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:13]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:15]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:16]** Get out.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:20]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:22]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:22 - 00:00:30]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales of the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:33]** Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:00:57 - 00:01:01]** Welcome back to we'll save in the interstellar tales from the extra galactic adventure anthology.

**[00:01:01 - 00:01:03]** I'm Kevin Decker, your GM for unknown treasures.

**[00:01:05 - 00:01:07]** This is our 52nd episode, 52nd year.

**[00:01:08 - 00:01:10]** And we, we are weekly podcast.

**[00:01:10 - 00:01:11]** This, this show comes out.

**[00:01:11 - 00:01:14]** This is, we've been doing junkers delight for one full year.

**[00:01:14 - 00:01:19]** And I'm so honored to have Jason Keely with us on again for this episode.

**[00:01:20 - 00:01:21]** I think it's very important.

**[00:01:25 - 00:01:28]** And I know I told you off air, but I think it's, I still am quite embarrassed by it.

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:34]** That when I first read this book, never GMing before in my life, um, I wrote it out on paper.

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:35]** I have the paper on my desk.

**[00:01:35 - 00:01:37]** So I remembered about how much of an idiot I am.

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:40]** And I, I was just like, Oh yeah, that's going to take this long.

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:41]** And that'll take that long.

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:44]** I calculated 50 or sorry, 13 episodes, 13.

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:46]** And we're now on 52.

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:49]** So, um, yeah, what should have only been a couple of months.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:51]** It's lasting a lifetime.

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:52]** We're so close to the end.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:55]** We are at that final fight.

**[00:01:56 - 00:02:00]** Before we get there, though, Jason, you have some questions for us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:02]** I have a question for all of you, actually.

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:05]** And feel free to answer this in any order that you wish.

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:12]** And this is the thing that people say to maybe get slightly annoyed about when we're at cons and all.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:20]** But I want to hear something very briefly about your favorite character, be it in a Starfinder game, that aren't one of these five characters.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:35]** of four characters or any other system favorite character does it have to be a tabletop character no you can tell if it's something that's something maybe your own creation or something you've done yeah and that's just your favorite but if you can't think of one tell me your favorite character in fiction okay wow

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:37]** This is a stumper.

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:39]** I didn't realize this would be such a stumper.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:44]** Yeah, this is a really good question.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:46]** It's tough because how do you measure it the best?

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:49]** I could give you my most entertaining.

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:51]** I could give you the most intriguing question.

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:58]** I could give you the best character arc, but the best overall is a tough one to answer for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:03]** The parameters are yours to decide what favorite means to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:18]** So then I'm going to go with, and forgive me because this is going to feel self-serving, the character that got me hooked on this show before I joined it, Will's Dr. Kuntu Okada's.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:36]** thank you yeah that's awesome yeah that's I was a fan long before I was a cast member and that was the one like oh I've never heard a character like this before Will's blushing yeah I mean it might be the pink hue behind me but yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:37]** I'll take next.

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:39]** I'm a big fan of our show for sure.

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:41]** And I think we have a lot of great characters.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:45]** But I am also a huge fan of the STF crew, Strange Table Fellows.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:50]** And I got to meet John and Adam in person.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:54]** And John's characters always... He's got two characters.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:58]** He plays Vincent on one and he plays Zeno on the other.

**[00:03:58 - 00:04:01]** And I think both of them are incredible characters.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:03]** And his voice just leads you to...

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:12]** And it's funny because in the one game, Zeno is an android, but I always picture him as an SRO, a large humanoid robot.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:15]** And it's just so fitting to his voice and the way he plays it.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:20]** And I think he's my favorite character of all TTRPG.

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:21]** Shout out to you, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:23]** Yeah, this is going to be another shout out to you, John.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:29]** I really liked the Akeshi Rivner that we met in the main show.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:29]** Frog?

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:30]** Yeah.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:32]** You brought him to life in such a way.

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:34]** It was very endearing.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:35]** Thank you.

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:43]** We had a moment, you know, like Dr. Okay and him, you know, like empathize with one another for the condition.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:44]** It was good.

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:45]** It was a great moment.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:46]** I liked it a lot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:47]** Jason, do you know who Krog is?

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:48]** It's book two.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:50]** Oh, I think so.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:51]** One of the lab experiments.

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:52]** Yeah, he had the lab experiment.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:54]** He still had the mentality.

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:55]** Yeah, right, right, yeah.

**[00:04:55 - 00:05:01]** And he actually made an appearance in this show as a small Ikesh-T fighter in the arena.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:02]** Before...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:19]** yeah that was cool yeah before yeah and then you were like yeah kelly might make a return who knows i think you should go but i was just gonna say we brought frog onto our team that was fun yeah it was good it was good but john i wanted john to play him forever but anyway uh you're up john


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:22]** I can't think of anything.

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:30]** Classic GM PC situation that the GM's like, can I have one less thing that I'm taking care of for sure?

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:31]** It's funny.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:33]** You said the parameters are your own.

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:34]** And I started thinking back.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:35]** I'm like...

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:36]** Where do I begin?

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:40]** Because I started playing with third edition, which quickly became 3.5.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:47]** And I think all – and Vinny is part of that crew of high school friends who still play that.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:54]** And I think the most fun to play, just fun pure mechanically –

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:58]** that I just was very wild, and I don't know what happened.

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:05]** But they would have this series that was called The Quintessential, and it was like The Quintessential Monk, and then The Quintessential Cleric.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:06]** Oh, yeah, yeah, I remember this.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:07]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:14]** And they had one, I believe, I always loved monks, so I would always play a lot of monks, and I had The Quintessential Monk.

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:19]** And I think they had a Quintessential Chaos Mage episode,

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:22]** And it was definitely not third party like it was put out.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:31]** But then there was something about it where it was literally like you create your own spells and they gave this like several tables of like, well, if it's based on this and then do this and then do this.

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:33]** And it was just very wild.

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:41]** But with every spell you create, there was this mechanic where you would step closer and closer to your mind being introduced to the unknowableness of chaos.

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:44]** So then another step down the path of chaos.

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:44]** Exactly.

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:44]** Exactly.

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:46]** So then things would start to happen to you.

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:57]** And, and I just recall that being a very fun, pure TTRPG, like, Hey, I'm going to create a cool character and, and get to have a chance to, you know, try something that's outside of the norm.

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:59]** Didn't play him for very long.

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:00]** Um, but yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:07]** So what's funny is I revisited that book when we were talking about my character in threefold, um, to try to find some inspiration.

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:09]** And cause I was curious about that mechanic specifically.

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:14]** It was basically, it was like, if you critically succeed, um,

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:15]** You take a step down the path of chaos.

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:20]** 20 of those steps and you become whatever element that you are focused on.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:22]** So like if you're a stone chaos mage.

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:22]** That's right.

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:23]** You are stone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:24]** You just become stone.

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:25]** Gone forever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:26]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:29]** Kelly, do you have something?

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:40]** Yeah, it's difficult, but if I have to think back to, I'm sort of new to GT RPGs, only the last three or four years or whatever, but I think one of my favorite things to play against was John's Nothic.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:41]** We had a D&D campaign.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:43]** I think it was a Nothic, right?

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:46]** It was like a big one-eyed monster that was in that cave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:46]** It wasn't that big.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:49]** It was like regular size, but it was just creepy.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:49]** It was so creepy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:53]** It would just like come out of the shadows around a rock and be like... And it would just talk into your mind.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:55]** What was its voice again, John?

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:57]** Could you please like... I don't recall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:59]** I don't recall what that voice was.

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:03]** I don't want to break your beautiful nostalgia that you have, so thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:05]** Wouldn't it try to like inception the players?

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:08]** I can't remember what it was, but it would get into your mind somehow and talk to you.

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:09]** Yeah.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:10]** And it was just like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:12]** It was telling us secrets from our past and stuff.

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:17]** We were fresh to the game and the only people who knew our past were us and John.

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:20]** So everything that was said was like, what the f***?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:23]** Mine was like, never go to Butterskull Ranch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:26]** Or something like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:26]** Which we never did.

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:28]** Yeah, which we haven't yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:29]** Wait, did I mishear the question?

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:31]** I thought it was just like all TTRPG.

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:36]** My favorite character by far of all of my characters is Rick19.

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:38]** And that's all I'm going to say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:41]** Minus yours if we're talking about the ones that I love.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:41]** I love Dr. Okay.

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:49]** It was sort of, you know, I never expected everyone to sort of pick maybe a character that they played, but I also just left it wide open to be whatever you thought.

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:51]** What about you, Jason?

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:51]** Oh, gosh.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:52]** No, don't turn it back on me.

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:56]** You're not allowed to do that.

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:57]** Whoa, whoa, hold on a second.

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:58]** No, no, no.

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:12]** If we were talking about characters that I really enjoy playing when I get to play, one thing that we've had played and come back to every once in a while is sort of a British murder mystery game that's sort of set in the 20s or whatever.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:17]** And I play Nan, who's an old grandma at this small British town.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:21]** And she's like, she's got like, you know, maybe hundreds of grandkids.

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:24]** And she can always just sort of like, part of the shtick is like, oh, yeah, we know who this person is.

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:27]** This is my, this is, this is our, this is, this is our Kevin.

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:31]** He's my, you know, my grandson, you know, from.

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:34]** from one of my three sons or something like that.

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:35]** Oh, you can help us out.

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:37]** But she also likes to drink.

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:39]** She's also constantly getting drunk.

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:43]** What is her class and abilities?

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:43]** None.

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:49]** I think we're using gumshoe for that and barely even that.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:55]** We're just sort of mostly doing improv sort of stuff and the GM makes up a mystery and we try to solve it.

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:56]** That's so neat.

**[00:09:57 - 00:09:57]** That's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:09:58 - 00:09:59]** It's fun.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:05]** Well, I'm very glad that you're here, Jason, and thank you so much again and again and again for being here.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:07]** You're welcome.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:13]** But it's time to get down to the purpose of being here, and that's for you to kill these four players.

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:20]** Dotrulu, the Shabad leader of the True Warriors, is currently battering these people around.

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:28]** In fact, last time he killed Rolu and left him lying in a lump of Kasathan on the floor.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:29]** So let's play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:30]** Let's play.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:32]** If I may begin.

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:34]** No.

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:35]** Okay.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:35]** Sorry.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:36]** You got to do some stuff for us.

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:39]** But I meant when we get to play.


## Speaker_0

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:39]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:40]** No, we're in, we're in.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:42]** I was going to just do like a little bit of recap.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:52]** Let me just tell, just for the listener, last time, Dotrulu and Tez Tronin and three more, actually technically four, but one of them died immediately with the gunshot.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:54]** That's right.

**[00:10:54 - 00:11:02]** Four adds, as I learned last time, came charging in and they've actually scattered the crew a little bit.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:03]** We now have...

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:12]** Everybody's kind of clumped in the middle, except there's Yasuki, Truoria up on the right on the third column, third horizontal hallway.

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:21]** And we have a Truoria in the second horizontal hallway that is almost flanking Rolu and Chak with Dotrulu.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:24]** Then we have Testronin is in that same hallway.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:26]** She stepped back a little bit and gave herself a heal.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:29]** I did forget to do the embed on that one.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:32]** So Will, while we're at it, roll me a d6.

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:33]** Nice.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:39]** And then there's one more Yusuke that's all the way up at the top and coming around the back, but our players do not know that.

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:44]** And then we have Thaddeus and Torme standing just directly north of Dotrulu.

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:47]** So I think that's everybody.

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:49]** Four points of damage.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:50]** I'll take that from her.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:51]** Okay.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:53]** What were you going to say, Jason?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:53 - 00:12:01]** I was just going to say, after breaking down Rulu, I think Dotrulu is just going to turn down this hallway here to


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:13]** to speak to the other two and say, your magic man is down this close to stepping on your little potted plant, so I have a proposition for you, if you like.

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:15]** Let's hear it.

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:19]** One of yous fights me one-on-one for the Stellar Flare.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:24]** Look, I'm in a good mood.

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:26]** I'll even let you just sort of bandage yourself up for a minute.

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:32]** And I won't even bother to fix this, whatever wound that your Kasatha friend did to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:40]** Thaddeus, like, on the opportunity to bandage oneself ahead of time, thinks about it and kind of scratches his, like, hairy chin.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:45]** But then he's like, if we do it that way to Trulu, you'll win.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:46]** So it's not going to happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:51]** Yeah, I'm the house, and the house always wins here in Cafe Depot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:58]** Look, this way it's just going to take forever of me cutting you down one at a time.

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:02]** I figure this time we just do it fair and some of your other friends can walk away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:04]** I'm not in a self-sacrificing mood.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:07]** This planet may have been yours once.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:08]** But it's ours now.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:11]** It belongs to the free captains.

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:13]** We witch where it's made your kind.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:15]** We can unmake it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:24]** When we're done with you, Goldhorn will take the scraps of your remaining empire, and I'll find a nice cozy spot for myself to settle in.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:29]** Maybe your old throne room or wherever you park yourself when you're not swinging your doshka around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:33]** Hey, guys, that's some big talk for not being right next to him.


## Speaker_0

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:36]** LAUGHTER


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:40]** You've taken down our Cobb, but he's gone down several times before.

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:42]** You won't take out all of us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:45]** Tremay on the mind link's going to hit up Rex.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:48]** Jack will be like, you have healing serums, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:50]** Of course I don't have healing serums.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:52]** I never have healing serums.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:54]** Oh, boy.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:54]** Okay.

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:56]** Yeah, I mean, that was big talk, yeah.

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:59]** I'll probably be the first to die now.


## Speaker_0

**[00:13:59 - 00:13:59]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:02]** So are you guys turning him down?

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:04]** And I'm, I just, I want to comment.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:06]** I'm so glad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:11]** I was wondering if we could like take him up on the offer, but then not fight dirty.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:13]** Cause we're pirates.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:19]** Oh, you expected I was going to fight fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:21]** I am so glad I invited Jason to play.

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:22]** Don't you?

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:22]** Yeah.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:26]** This is excellent.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:26]** Cool.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:29]** So as GM, I have no idea how to handle this.

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:32]** Are you guys going to make an agreement?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:34]** Let's fight one on one.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:35]** Oh, you.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:37]** To me, you're volunteering.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:44]** I guess so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:45]** All right.

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:47]** Everyone stand down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:53]** He shouts throughout the ship and his true warriors can pull back to the shadows.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:57]** So as soon as you say that, these guys kind of withdraw.

**[00:14:57 - 00:15:02]** Their guns still pointed and they don't drop their weapons until they get around the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:04]** I'll even let you pick the venue.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:06]** You want to do it outside the ship?

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:07]** You want to do it in one of these rooms?

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:09]** You want to do it right here in the hallway?

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:10]** It don't matter to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:11]** Sure.


## Speaker_0

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:12]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:17]** Let's meet back here in five, ten, I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:19]** Give yourself a chance to ten minutes.

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:21]** Take yourself a ten minute break.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:28]** Thaddeus goes down to Rolu and he drags him up to the northernmost hallway before we get into the engine room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:30]** Okay.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:36]** I'm assuming I probably would use a resolve point to heal if we were still in a combat order, so I wouldn't.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:38]** die.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:39]** Yeah, by dragging.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:40]** Unless somebody healed me.

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:42]** I'm burning a resolve.

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:43]** I'm doing 10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:47]** I'm going to take you out of initiative order for now.

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:52]** I'm going to just re-roll all of this when you guys decide to break your truths.

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:55]** This is wild.

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:57]** This is awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:15:57 - 00:15:58]** I think I'm going to die.

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:01]** I think you're going to die.

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:02]** I think you're going to die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:04]** Don't you lose steps back to talk to Tez.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:05]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:12]** And as you do, she's stabbing herself again in the knee with another healing serum.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:13]** God dang it again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:15]** Here's what I want to do.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:20]** I, as Chuck, want to like, because everyone's gone to the engine room.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:22]** I'm assuming that was communicated over the comms.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:44]** chalk is going to like step down the hallway and pretend to go up but then because i have a polymorphic disguise oh my god what is going on i'm gonna like turn into some plant-based debris and i just want to eavesdrop on what dotrulu and test runner are saying


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:51]** I thought you were going to say that you were going to try to mold a rat out of your leaves and pretend to be one of the true warriors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:54]** That's a much better idea.

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:56]** I wish I was smarter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:59]** So there is a pile of debris right near them.

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:01]** Do you want to roll a stealth check?

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:02]** Or how does polymorph work?

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:05]** You're already a plant.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:06]** Wouldn't that just...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:09]** I mean, if you tell me I can just be a plant, I'm going to be a plant.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:10]** Let's see.

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:15]** You're an expert that allows you to change your appearance into something or someone totally different.

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:17]** I gain the shape changer subtype.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:19]** Why have I not been using this the whole time?

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:24]** Basically, I get a polymorph spell at will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:25]** All right.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:27]** What is the role on it, though?

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:29]** It's going to be perception versus something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:32]** It's a disguise check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:34]** And yeah, I think you're almost like your pedals.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:45]** You're almost like an octopus that like you flip all your pedals flat and you crouch down and then your pedals kind of turn like gray and black and try to give you that just pile of rubble look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:46]** Yep.

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:48]** So I get an extra 1d6 on a disguise check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:54]** Since you are kind of right at the corner of Dotrulu, I think as you walk up, Dotrulu, you kind of get a sense of something.

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:56]** So give me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:56]** Yeah.

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:59]** And Vinny, you roll... Should I make a stealth check?

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:02]** Or I'm going to let this resolve before I ask that question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:07]** Disguise against my perception.

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:08]** I forgot to write it down.

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:09]** I'm not paying any attention.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:12]** That's a 9 with a natural 1.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:13]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:15]** This is in the bag for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:20]** And my disguise skill is plus eight, so I literally cannot fail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:21]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:21]** Amazing.

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:27]** But I'm going to roll it anyway.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:30]** I rolled a total of a three on the dice.

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:32]** But it passes.

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:34]** Stoppable forces, movable objects.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:35]** Yeah.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:35]** Yep.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:37]** Yeah, it passes.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:37]** It does.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:42]** Paddy's going to talk to Termay and be like, Termay, are you sure about this?

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:43]** No.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:45]** I'm not going.

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:47]** He whispers to him.

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:49]** He's like, I'm not going to let it happen.

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:52]** If it gets close, we're getting involved.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:54]** Yeah, I would hope so.

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:55]** We're dirty pirates.

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:57]** We just fight dirty.

**[00:18:58 - 00:18:58]** That's right.

**[00:18:59 - 00:18:59]** We're dirty.

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:01]** We have to get rid of this guy.

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:04]** I mean, Goldhorn, that's what he told us to do, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:07]** One way or another, Goldhorn always gets his way.

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:08]** This time won't be any different.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:13]** And then Thaddeus takes a serum and punches it into Rolly's body.

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:14]** A little bit too forcefully?

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:15]** You stabilize yourself.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:18]** That can make you awake, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:26]** Yeah, I was going to ask if anybody, just to metagame very slightly, if anybody could stabilize me, it would avoid me having to spend another resolve point.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:27]** We're out of initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:28]** You can roll a medicine check, yeah.

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:31]** What is the DC for that, though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:32]** To stabilize?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:33]** Yeah.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:35]** It's like 15, 10 even.

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:38]** I trust Jason on that.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:39]** I'm guessing.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:41]** Come on, don't trust me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:44]** First aid to a dying creature in the DC of this chunk is 15.

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:45]** 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:45]** That was right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:46]** Nice.

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:48]** So locked up in here.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:49]** Will, you got what, sorry?

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:51]** I got 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:51]** Oh, beautiful.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:52]** Okay.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:53]** Dope.

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:57]** So you're stabilized, and then... One mark, one healing serum for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:59]** Which is a D8.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:01]** You want to roll that?

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:02]** Roll it for yourself, please.

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:04]** Since you're administering it.

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:05]** You might have physical dice, so go for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:06]** Okay.

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:07]** That's cool.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:09]** Cool, cool, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:10]** Ooh, all eight.

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:12]** Nice.

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:13]** Very nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:13]** Mr. Keith.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:22]** Well, while that is all going on, of course, Don'tru is down here with Tez, giving something for Chuck to... You've got one, of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:26]** Tez.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:30]** And as he hears Don'tru starting to talk, he keys open his comms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:32]** There you go.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:37]** Just turns his leaf towards... These pirates ain't gonna play fair.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:38]** I know.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:39]** So why should we?

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:40]** What are you thinking?

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:43]** I know you ain't got a gun.

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:44]** Exactly.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:47]** I got my Corona pistol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:48]** Oh, you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:49]** Okay, good.

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:50]** My sword, though.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:51]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:59]** Well, um... Maybe you could, uh, you know, sneak up, uh... Creep up behind one of them and, uh...

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:01]** Keep them locked down.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:02]** We can handle that.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:04]** Just so they don't try anything too stupid.

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:06]** We'll take the flanks and we'll meet you around.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:11]** That guy who got shot in the face real bad, he can go home for the day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:15]** I will let him know.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:34]** and she says that and she turns like almost it's not quite a salute but she's it's almost like she has a military background and she stands up at attention and then makes almost like a bow face and marches down the hall and when she gets to the end she's going to wave to the Yosuke at the corner and then call him back all right

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:37]** So are you guys actually making your way towards the lab?

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:38]** Is that where you agreed to meet?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:40]** I think just right in front, yeah.

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:43]** I just said that Thaddeus is just healing Rolu here.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:44]** He wasn't going to go to the lab proper.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:45]** Just in the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:50]** Yeah, we're right outside the vestibule about to go to the lab, I think.

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:52]** Yeah, near the doors.

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:56]** Rolu props himself up and takes a 10-minute rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:21:56 - 00:22:02]** And during that time, you all realize, Termite, I am worried for you.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:05]** Even if you do somehow fight Dirty, I am worried for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:11]** Yeah, well, we Witch Lords, I think we're the only ones who can face them.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:14]** I think, as you're saying that, probably the...

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:16]** The talk between Tez and Del Trullo comes over the comms.

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:19]** Yeah, we can listen in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:24]** They're not going to fight fair, so let's just try to do our best.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:26]** Maybe we can... I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:31]** Whoever is near Tez, it sounds like Tez is going to come up and...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:22:31 - 00:23:00]** keep an eye out possibly be on the ready so we need to have a cue or something in case well like a code word a code word perhaps but can we really trust Tremata bangerang is Tremata a shadow anchorman well he's in what's that the code word sure anchorman anchorman what is that what you said I said bangerang like from bangerang oh sorry sorry yeah

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:02]** Sorry, there's still some calm.

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:04]** Don't really want to be doing something.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:07]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:07]** All right.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:10]** What happens when we do that?

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:10]** We all attack.

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:13]** I think we're just going to, well, okay.

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:15]** We'll see how this goes, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:19]** And so that 10 minutes is winding down.

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:25]** And right before Don't Truly steps away, Tez gives him the wink and says, we'll make sure they do nothing.

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:26]** It's you on them.

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:28]** And we know you can take all three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:29]** All right, Tez.

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:30]** Just, uh, you know.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:33]** You know what to do.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:35]** That's why you're my number two.

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:38]** All right, your ten minutes are up.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:39]** Where are we doing this?

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:39]** Right here?

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:40]** Yeah.

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:41]** All right.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:48]** Just does a big old neck crack that echoes like a shotgun shot throughout the hallway.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:56]** He's reloaded his cross bolter at this point, just in case, but he's mostly focused on holding up the dash coat.

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:58]** Igniting it.

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:02]** We could just stand here and, you know, hit one another.

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:04]** What do you got?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:09]** I got nothing to really hit you with other than some spells.

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:14]** You think you took out all of our casters, my friend.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:15]** You were wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:18]** All right, we'll do this to make it utterly fair.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:19]** I'll...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:23]** I'll stand a few paces away from you, and you can shoot spells at me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:24]** Okay.

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:27]** So are we, like, in initiative or what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:28]** I don't know.

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:30]** Let's see who goes first, I imagine, right?

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:31]** Because that's probably going to matter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:34]** Should we all roll initiative so then it'll just roll through?

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:36]** Kev, what do you want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:40]** I think we should all roll initiative just to make sure it's not complicated later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:41]** Okay.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:42]** Okay.

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:42]** 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:46]** 16 for Thaddeus.

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:48]** Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:50]** 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:53]** 15 for Treme.

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:54]** 14 for Rolu.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:55]** 14 for Rolu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:57]** 7 for Chuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:57]** 7 for Chuck.

**[00:24:58 - 00:24:58]** That makes sense.

**[00:24:58 - 00:25:00]** Again, I love how dice rolls just make sense.

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:04]** He's hiding out in the middle there, so of course he's going to be the last to act.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:06]** I also got 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:09]** Okay, so who has the higher bonus?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:11]** I think I only have a plus one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:12]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:18]** Yeah, I have a plus five as a blitz soldier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:21]** Okay, give me one second while I roll the rest of mine.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:21]** Wow.

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:27]** So the one human true warrior left.

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:30]** I'm going to move him out of order, because you told him he could.

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:33]** And of course he's going to listen, because he's a good soldier.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:35]** Cleave has that shot in the face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:39]** It's not going to be any use to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:44]** And then lastly, we have Miss Tez.

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:44]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:44]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:47]** Whoo-wee, all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:53]** Can Thaddeus, like, while they're prepping to fight, just move past Termay?

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:56]** He's going to go near where Shock's chilling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:59]** I think if you try that, Dottrulu's going to see it, and we're already in initiative order.

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:00]** So you might question it.

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:04]** I'll leave that to Jason to decide.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:10]** Were you just going south towards the entrance of the ship?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:15]** Yeah, but actually I think Thaddeus would probably want to go north, actually.


## Speaker_0

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:16]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:17]** If I don't see it.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:18]** Well, he won't see it anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:22]** Before we do anything else, Chalk, roll me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:23]** 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:24]** Of course.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:33]** So one more thing you heard between Dotrulu and Tez is Tez said, I'll bring in the android.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:34]** Okay.

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:36]** What is happening?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:37]** What's going on?

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:41]** Before we hop into this, who has the watch?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:42]** The watch?

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:42]** What do you mean?

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:43]** Oh, the watch.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:44]** Yes.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:45]** Who took the watch?

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:49]** Avari 8's watch from the lab.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:52]** Is it still sitting in the lab because none of you guys grabbed it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:53]** It wasn't Rolo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:55]** Yeah, I think it's still in the lab.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:56]** It's still in the lab.

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:57]** Cool.

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:57]** Hold on.

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:58]** I'm going to go put a marker up there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:58 - 00:27:03]** That actually makes sense because we were in the lab about to leave, and then we got threatened and had to start fighting.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:05]** So, yeah, we probably would have left it in the lab.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:06]** I'm just going to search for watch.

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:07]** Okay.

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:08]** So what is happening?

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:09]** Who is doing what now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:10]** All right.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:12]** Yeah, let's kick it off.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:12]** Yeah.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:13]** One shot.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:16]** I think if...

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:23]** Just from the two of us, if the rest of you aren't doing anything, I think I beat Jermaine on the initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:28]** I technically have a 16 initiative, so just ahead of that, I'm just going to move up and over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:31]** I'll just start the full round.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:39]** Let me... Data tools... Sort... Okay.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:39]** Thaddeus moved.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:42]** Tez technically did her move as well.

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:46]** The Yusokis are each going to do their move.

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:46]** That is your up.

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:52]** Dotrulu, it's now your turn in your duel against Terme.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:54]** Three, two, one, go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:57 - 00:27:59]** I rolled another natural one.

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:01]** This cross bolter is no good to me.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:03]** Natural one.

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:06]** On that cross bolter shot, it goes wide.

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:08]** Critical fail.

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:10]** I think that's a critical fail.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:11]** Oh, you guys do critical fumbles?

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:13]** We do, yes.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:14]** What happens?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:18]** You draw cards and you can tell John's going to flip through them and you tell him when to stop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:22]** And that's the whole shtick here.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:25]** I'm going to just cut some cards, and then I'll just thumb through them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:27]** And you and I have never met before.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:28]** Definitely not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:30]** This is a brand new deck of critical formal cards.

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:31]** Yep, here we go.

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:32]** Ready?

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:33]** I'm going to start going through.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:34]** Three, two, one.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:36]** Stop.

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:37]** Okay, stop.

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:39]** I'm going to read the top card.

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:42]** This is a ranged attack, right?

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:43]** It's a ranged attack.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:45]** Okay, it's a ranged attack.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:47]** Is it kinetic or energy?

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:50]** It is a kinetic arrow.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:52]** Okay.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:53]** Pinprick.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:56]** You gain the bleeding condition one damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:58 - 00:29:01]** Yeah.

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:07]** So I guess I would say the cross bolter snaps back.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:10]** The arrow kind of snaps back a bit and cuts him on the cheek.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:12]** It breaks entirely.

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:15]** Yeah, the wire of the bike.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:16]** Ah!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:17]** Amazing.

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:17]** Amazing.

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:20]** So you take one damage.

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:21]** I'll take that one damage.

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:24]** There's a moment for Termay there.

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:26]** Yeah, wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:31]** And he just throws the rest of it to the ground and just yells in frustration.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:33]** Termay, it's your turn.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:35]** Actually, you still have a movement action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:37]** Do you want to do anything with that?

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:37]** I do.

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:38]** I'm just doing it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:42]** I'm going to try and do my wall of steam.

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:51]** A cone of steam comes around you basically from the floor.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:56]** It seems to rise this fiery pillar that encircles you.

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:59]** And I would think it would encircle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:02]** I mean, it's basically a cake because it's a 10 foot diameter.

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:04]** It's five foot radius, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:04]** Yeah.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:07]** So he'd be, like, right in it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:11]** He's 10 feet wide, so, like, he's both inside and touching the walls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:16]** He wouldn't be touching the walls if you're doing a 10-foot radius, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:17]** It's a 5-foot radius, 10-foot diameter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:18]** Okay.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:19]** Sorry.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:20]** And what did Will say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:25]** Will said... Yeah, I mean, that's kind of, like, how I would cast it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:25]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:27]** Amazing.

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:28]** Circle mainstream, huh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:29]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:30]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:35]** It's, yeah, you're like almost in your, you know, playable area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:36]** And you get a 20% mischance now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:39]** 20% mischance and you take 3d6 of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:39]** D4.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:41]** Because you're contacting the wall.

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:46]** And every time you stand, like as long as you're contacting the wall, you're going to take 3d6 of damage.

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:48]** So no matter where you, unless you get completely out of it.

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:50]** It's d4, by the way.

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:50]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:51]** 3d4?

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:52]** Okay.

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:53]** So go ahead and roll your 3d4 now because...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:54]** Okay.

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:56]** Six points.

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:57]** All right.

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:57]** Only that.

**[00:30:58 - 00:30:58]** Nothing.

**[00:30:58 - 00:30:59]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:00]** Very nice.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:00]** Locked.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:02]** That is just your standard action, right?

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:03]** Yes.

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:05]** What are you doing otherwise?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:10]** I'm going to try and stealthily move down, like kite you, I guess.

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:11]** I don't know.

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:13]** So I can do... Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:15]** And we did mess this up last time.

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:16]** This is a concentration spell.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:16]** I have to focus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:17]** Yeah.

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:18]** Concentrate.

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:24]** Let it never be said I don't live up to my mistakes, but we messed up at 49.

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:26]** That was my bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:28]** Oh, so you have to maintain concentration now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:30]** Yeah, because I want to keep it on him.

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:31]** So I'm just going to concentrate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:33]** Which is a standard action to maintain it.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:36]** And if you get attacked, it fails.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:39]** Yeah, I would assume I'd be able to do it around a corner, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:41]** I don't think there's any limitations to that.

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:43]** Yeah.

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:43]** Anybody objecting?

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:44]** No?

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:44]** Nope.

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:45]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:48]** Rolu, it's your turn.

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:51]** Rolu sees this happen and this wall of steam come around.

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:57]** And I think two of Rolu's hands grip the rifle tighter.

**[00:31:57 - 00:32:00]** And then Rolu is going to ready an action.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:04]** Actually, he's going to let it go by.

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:06]** He's going to let the moment go by.

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:12]** And he's going to say to Thaddeus, he's going to whisper and say, Thaddeus, how far did you get?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:18]** I'm up the hall to the right of the northmost hall before that void engine thing or whatever.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:19]** With the watches.

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:20]** I'm going to wrap around.

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:22]** I'm going to keep an eye.

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:25]** Well, we'll see what I do to that other guy over there.

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:28]** I think there's Soki or something.

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:28]** Why do you ask?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:31]** Because we need to be ready to take down Dojulu.

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:32]** I'm with you, Carl.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:34]** I'll keep an eye and let you know.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:35]** I'm with you.

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:37]** And that's Roller's turn.

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:37]** Who's next?

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:37]** Chalk.

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:38]** Chalk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:42]** I love that we kind of kept the same initiative from before.

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:44]** I know.

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:55]** I'm going to sneak from the bottom corner of this inset to the top corner so that I can keep an eye on what's actually happening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:57]** So, Jason, you're going to need to roll a perception on that.

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:59]** Oh, sure, yeah.

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:02]** He has concealment, and I don't know how that affects a perception check.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:04]** You're kind of playing it loose and wild.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:06]** Consume it.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:07]** I don't know.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:08]** It doesn't block line of sight.

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:12]** It just sort of makes things trickier to see.

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:13]** I can't remember.

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:16]** I got a 26 on this perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:18]** Oh, cool.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:23]** So I'm going to use my new envoy special ability, covert expert.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:30]** When I'm rolling bluff to size or stealth, I can basically take advantage from another popular TTRPG game.

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:34]** I can roll two D20s and take the better.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:36]** Good luck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:37]** Yeah, I basically need a natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:39]** Oh, no.

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:43]** Great luck.

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:44]** And I got one!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:46]** Yeah!

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:48]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:51]** I don't know which diet it would have been, but yeah.

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:53]** So that is a 27.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:54]** All right.

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:55]** So that is your movement.

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:56]** You are unseen, correct?

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:57]** Yes.

**[00:33:58 - 00:33:59]** Are you going to take any standard actions?

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:01]** That is your action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:03]** No, I'm just going to keep observing.

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:05]** I'm going to look for any funny business.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:06]** All right.

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:08]** That is the end of that round.

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:09]** We're going to move back to the top.

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:11]** I think everybody's going to hold positions.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:14]** Tez is going to hold position.

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:15]** We're back to Thaddeus.

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:17]** Thaddeus, are you doing anything shady?

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:17]** Of course you are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:29]** Thaddeus is going to make it almost all the way across the north horizontal hall before turning around the corner, but he'll wait right there because that's as far as he can move.

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:35]** Okay, so you are 10 feet from the corner of that, technically 5 feet plus your square.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:38]** Which goes then south at the far end, the far east end.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:47]** Thaddeus is not aware of this, but the listeners could know that there is a Yusoki standing there 15 feet south of that same corner.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:49]** Oh, this is so cool.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:50]** It's Dotru's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:58]** Screaming from the steam and the blood and the bleeding, Dotru steps out and is like,

**[00:34:58 - 00:34:59]** Oh, you're going to run, are you?

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:02]** And starts by moving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:04]** As you step out, you take damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:05]** Sure, damage me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:07]** I dare you.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:08]** You won't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:09]** You won't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:10]** That was pretty good.

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:12]** 11 points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:14]** Yikes.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:15]** I don't like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:18]** And then you take the one point from your bleeding at the top of your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:19]** Yeah.

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:24]** I forget how it works in each of these systems.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:30]** Is that the random chance that it just stops at the end of my turn?

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:33]** According to the core rulebook.

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:38]** Yeah, Starfinder bleeding happens until someone does it.

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:40]** Which is amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:42]** Do I want to take an attack of opportunity?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:46]** See, this is what you got to... That's what you do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:48]** Two of you can take a tax opportunity as I walk by.

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:54]** I'm trusting you to basically... So, big rig, big rig, big rig.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:58]** So, Jason, there's a... There's a mechanic.

**[00:35:58 - 00:36:01]** I've kind of started with this character where basically I'm like...

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:03]** Maybe he would, maybe he wouldn't.

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:07]** I just roll a wisdom save.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:12]** And if it's less than the arbitrary threshold, then Chuck does some stupid s***.

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:13]** That's it.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:14]** That's a four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:22]** Before you do anything, what is the hidden rule?

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:24]** Because you did pass a stealth check.

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:27]** and you are hidden, so I believe you get an AC bonus or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:29]** I'm probably flat-footed.

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:31]** That's what I think it is, flat-footed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:33]** So it's minus two to your AC?

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:35]** Yep.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:37]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:41]** So... Chuck, don't do any... for the attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:44]** Just hold.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:47]** This tiny little bit of moss jumps out at me, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:49]** Wow.

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:49]** What a miss.

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:52]** That's a 10 against KAC.

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:58]** So you just hear, like, because you just hit your armor pieces near your ankles.

**[00:36:58 - 00:37:05]** You just hear, like, the of his pincered vines trying to pinch you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:07]** And Rolu, are you taking an attack of opportunity?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:10]** Would I have noticed shock attacking?

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:13]** Because if I would, then I probably would.

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:16]** And if I didn't notice, that's where I'm drawing the threshold.


## Speaker_0

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:17]** Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:19]** I think you guys will roll a perception check.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:20]** Okay.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:22]** I'm not sure how observant Ralu is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:24]** What's your perception modifier?

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:24]** Me?

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:25]** It is four.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:27]** You couldn't possibly see it.

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:28]** I rolled a 27.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:31]** But you were also doing an action, so I feel like... Oh, yeah, that's fair.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:32]** Let's give you a penalty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:34]** You're jumping out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:35]** What would be a good penalty?

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:36]** A minus four penalty to that?

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:39]** Or is that too little?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:40]** That's your call.

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:42]** I think you said a DC in your head.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:42]** Yep.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:45]** I rolled a 19, and my bonus is four, so that's a 23.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:47]** I think you see it.

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:50]** I don't know if you recognize that it's Chalk attacking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:52]** Something attacked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:57]** I think you make the assumption knowing that Chalk was... You're like, wait, where is Chalk?

**[00:37:58 - 00:38:00]** You're like, that's... Chalk, where are you?

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:01]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:24]** okay it's hella different but yeah yeah it looks a lot different but uh yeah then then i then i think i'm i'm gonna take well i can only take an attack of opportunity if i have a melee weapon out and i don't think i do because i'm using two of my hands there's broadcasting in two of my hands for uh the range weapon gotcha so i can't okay uh as jojo gets sort of snipped a little bit uh as he walks by uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:50]** chalk just looks down at him with just disdain stay in your lane potted plant um that's the only only insult i can think of for a right slip um and as uh he turns the corner and uh sees jimmy uh raises up the dash cube to to smash down on him he uh says into his communicator uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:53]** Tez, you know what to do.

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:55]** Kill the android.

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:56]** Oh, no.

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:57]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:58]** Oh, no.

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:59]** This is what we get for breaking the deal.

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:10]** Real quick, Will, I'm going to use Chronomatic Defense as my reaction because I didn't use an AOO2, and you're going to get a plus two bonus to your AC until the end of my next turn.

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:14]** It's when an attack is declared but before the result is known.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:18]** So it might not matter, but Will, you get that bonus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:20]** I get a plus two to my AC.

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:21]** AC, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:22]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:23]** Thanks, Brolu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:26]** We're going to resolve the Tez stuff in a minute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:27]** Yeah, this is wild.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:28]** Treme, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:30]** I got a 17 on my attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:31]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:32]** You're still attacking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:35]** I'm attacking.

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:36]** All right.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:37]** Take some damage.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:40]** 11 fire and flame damage.

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:42]** Oh, man.

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:43]** Crush it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:43]** Love it.

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:45]** Nothing.

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:45]** Wow.

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:47]** More than I can deal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:49]** All right, so that now finishes Dotru's turn.

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:50]** Tormat, you're up.

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:51]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:54]** I guess I'm going to take a guarded step back.

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:55]** I guess I'm in range, right?

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:56]** Yeah, I have reach here.

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:58]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:39:58 - 00:40:03]** And then I'm going to...

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:06]** Cast adamantine shot again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:07]** Ooh.

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:08]** Wow.

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:08]** Wow.

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:09]** There it is.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:09]** There it is.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:11]** That's your last level two slot?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:13]** That's my last level one.

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:13]** That's level one.

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:14]** Level one.

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:14]** Empty the chamber.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:15]** That's a level one spell?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:16]** Yeah.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:16]** Oh, my God.

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:17]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:18]** It's great.

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:20]** It's one of those variable spells, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:23]** Yeah, you can, if I do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:23]** Extra D8.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:25]** I should have done it.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:27]** I probably should have.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:33]** I can't retcon my spells for level two, so that's fine.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:35]** I'll do it at level one.

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:37]** And I get to roll three attacks.

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:39]** 16.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:40]** No.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:41]** No.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:44]** Okay.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:44]** 12.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:45]** Not going to do it.

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:46]** Let's get one.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:46]** Come on.

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:47]** Come on.

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:48]** Okay.

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:49]** Natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:54]** We also do crit cards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:55]** Do you want to do a crit card, Will, or no?

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:57]** David and Goliath.

**[00:40:58 - 00:40:59]** Do I press my luck on the crit card?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:06]** Just for history for you, Jason, is one time he almost got a kill shot, but the crit card stole it from him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:09]** Oh, because it stopped being double damage.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:12]** It did something that made it not work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:16]** I think it was like roll again, and it was like double or nothing type thing, and he failed the roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:18]** Oh, shoot.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:19]** Yeah, I think you have to take the card, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:21]** All right, card it.

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:22]** You want to card it?

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:23]** All right, you're carding it.

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:24]** Here we go.

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:25]** But I get to do my one.

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:25]** Hang on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:26]** Right?

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:31]** So don't forget, though, that this spell has the critical knockdown effect.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:32]** Oh, knockdown.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:33]** Yeah, it's really good.

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:35]** You could just take the damage in the knockdown.

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:36]** Yes.

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:38]** Yeah.

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:39]** Okay, let's do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:40]** Okay.

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:41]** Damage in the knockdown.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:43]** I don't know why I just talked myself into getting knocked down.

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:44]** I know, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:46]** You'll get up again.

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:48]** And I got an eight on my first.

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:53]** So let's do this one more time.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:54]** Come on.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:54]** Okay.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:55]** Six.

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:56]** So 14 points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:58]** Oh, I don't like that.

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:02]** And you're prone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:03]** And I'm prone on my butt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:04]** Oh my.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:05]** Prone on your butt.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:09]** That was your turn, Tremei.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:10]** Rolu, you're up.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:16]** You know, I'm worried that this is going to be, you're going to get killed right away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:18]** Well, that's all I had.

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:22]** Tremei's like, that's it.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:24]** That's the only thing I had.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:25]** All right.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:28]** Do I – man, I am worried about Vahri.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:38]** So the thing is, is that especially now with Dotrulu on their booty, I am thinking that I want to save Vahri.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:41]** So I'm going to start running to the front.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:43]** because that's the only place that they can come in.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:47]** So I'm going to make it around the corner.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:57]** That's 30 feet if I run into the zigzag hallway, and I think I need to use both actions to move.

**[00:42:57 - 00:43:03]** Shock, hop on my shoulder if you want to save Vahri, but also keep an eye on Dotrulu if you want to do that.

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:05]** I'm going to go save Vahri.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:07]** What?

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:11]** I thought the plan was to jump him.

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:14]** He's like, you're all leaving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:16]** That was before we knew.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:19]** And I can see now through the outside.

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:21]** Do I see Fari at all?

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:23]** Perception check.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:24]** Perception check.

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:26]** Real quick, that's going to be a seven.

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:31]** I'm looking down outside, straight out into the junk yards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:33]** Oh, I don't even know why I'd ask for a perception check then.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:34]** No, you don't see her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:35]** Ah, great.

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:35]** All right.

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:37]** Well, I double move.

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:37]** That's my turn.

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:41]** I am not playing smart, but I'm trying to play to the story, and it's not helping.

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:42]** All right, that's the end of my turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:43]** Chalk, you're up.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:44]** What are you doing?

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:51]** Seeing that Trulude knocked on his ass, Chalk finds a bit of extra confidence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:53]** Way to go, you big oaf.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:53 - 00:44:01]** Runs over and, like, tries to hit him with his pincered LVN again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:01]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:02]** That's a 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:06]** Against KAC is a miss.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:06]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:09]** I'm wearing a lot of armor.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:09]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:11]** Yeah.

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:19]** So you see Chuck amble over, and it's like, and it's just, like, scratching paint on your shoulder pads.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:20]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:22]** That's the end of that round.

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:24]** We're going back to the top.

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:32]** The first Yosuke, you hear they don't have comm units because they're poor desert gang members.

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:36]** But you hear one Yosuke kind of shout and he's talking to Dotrulu.

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:36]** What do we do?

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:37]** What do you need us to do?

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:38]** Kill them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:40]** Kill them all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:43]** And so this one's going to come around the corner with that command.

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:45]** Let me see.

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:45]** Hold on.

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:46]** Oh, wow.

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:46]** Okay.

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:47]** I didn't know you could do that.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:48]** Cool.

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:50]** He's going to get to right.

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:51]** I'm sorry.

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:52]** Right there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:53]** Where's right there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:55]** I'm making sure my math is right on that.

**[00:44:55 - 00:45:05]** He is going to go up around the corner and he's now just north of the, he's in the very north, very top horizontal hallway.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:08]** Just north of the windows into the server room.

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:10]** And he has a clean shot.

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:11]** Not a clean shot.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:12]** He has a, let's see.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:13]** Wait a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:18]** You took a minus four penalty to your AC with the prone condition, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:19]** Yes.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:20]** What was the number again?

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:22]** It was 15.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:24]** Was it 15?


## Speaker_0

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:25]** Actually, that is a hit.

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:28]** I always forget about the AC for me, bro.

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:29]** Sorry.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:29]** Sorry, y'all.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:30]** Rewind.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:32]** All right, stab me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:37]** All right, stab me.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:42]** So Jack reaches out with his Pinsir Delphan, rolls a 15 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:43]** All right, I'm prone.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:44]** That gets me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:45]** Cool.

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:46]** Nice.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:51]** For one plus two, three piercing damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:53]** Oh!

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:55]** A one, a two, a three.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:56]** One, two, three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:59]** I was going the lollipop route.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:01]** How many licks?

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:02]** Yeah.

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:04]** Cool.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:05]** That is the end of Chuck's turn.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:07]** Back to the Soki.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:10]** Like I was saying, he's going to run up and around the corner.

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:13]** And now he has a shot.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:15]** Let me just do my snapped corner.

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:17]** He does not have a clean shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:20]** It's kind of far, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:21]** I can take a penalty.

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:23]** It's fine.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:24]** It's fine.

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:24]** No big deal.

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:26]** It's cool.

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:27]** So it's partial cover.

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:29]** So you're going to get a plus four to your AC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:32]** And then the penalty for the distance.

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:33]** Yes, Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:36]** I got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:36]** Thank you.

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:39]** Gosh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:40]** This is for some game.

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:41]** Maybe it does hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:43]** It's only been doing this for a year.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:52]** I don't need to bother with AC or cover because that's a natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:53]** Oh, wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:55]** For what damage?

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:57]** Oh, no, for KAC or EAC?

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:58]** Natural 20.

**[00:46:58 - 00:46:58]** Doesn't matter.

**[00:46:58 - 00:46:59]** It's natural 20.

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:00]** Yeah, it's going to hit.

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:01]** It's going to hit.

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:02]** Boom, boom, boom, boom.

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:04]** What if my KAC was 21, though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:05]** I'm not targeting you.

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:07]** I'm targeting... Oh, okay.

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:08]** Treme.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:09]** Oh, my bad.

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:10]** Oh, man.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:10]** How are you?


## Speaker_0

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:11]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:12]** Because you're the target.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:15]** He said kill them all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:17]** It's the Yosuke on the left side.

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:18]** We'll get to the Yosuke on the right.

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:20]** I can't even see them though.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:21]** But he can see you.

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:23]** And he just hit you with a natural 20.

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:24]** So go ahead, pull out those cards.

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:26]** And I'll roll my double damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:29]** Doing the cards.

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:31]** Here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:33]** So that's 8 points of damage.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:35]** Just take that now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:36]** Okay, let me know.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:36]** Ready?

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:37]** Three, two, one.

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:39]** Stop.

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:40]** Okay, cool.

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:41]** Top.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:43]** You said it's a kinetic or energy attack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:44]** Kinetic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:46]** Kinetic.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:49]** I hope it hits you prone, because that'd be funny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:50]** The two of you are just on the ground slapping each other.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:52]** Okay, no, no, no, no.

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:57]** Two forearm dudes just wriggling on the floor.

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:58]** Extreme melee.

**[00:47:58 - 00:47:59]** Is this a melee attack?

**[00:47:59 - 00:47:59]** No.

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:00]** Okay, cool.

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:01]** Strange.

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:02]** Two, two, two.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:04]** Bonus effect.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:07]** The attack has the automatic weapon special property.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:08]** Core rulebook 180.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:12]** That just means you kind of spray in a cone.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:14]** I don't think that does anything.

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:15]** Because nobody else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:16]** It would just hit everybody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:18]** Yeah, it would just hit everybody.

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:18]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:19]** That's a weird job.

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:19]** Okay.

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:20]** Cool.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:21]** That's what he does, though.

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:22]** Hang on.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:26]** Though that does mean that he shoots out all his rounds, though, and has to reload, though, I believe.

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:26]** I guess so, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:29]** But wouldn't that also mean he doesn't hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:32]** It's everyone, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:36]** Because the cone is only the length of the weapons range.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:42]** I'm going to overrule that and say the hit hit, and then it does the full auto on everything else.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:44]** Love it.

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:45]** Shooting all over the place, nothing happens.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:50]** But he's going to have to reload, so he's going to lose out on a move action next round.

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:50]** Cool.

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:51]** It is the other Yusuke.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:54]** Now, Kelly, we can discuss your situation.

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:56]** Yes, Jason?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:57]** What are you doing?

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:57]** You're wasting all those bullets.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:48:57 - 00:49:03]** You know how much those cost?

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:04]** Good help's hard to find, you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:09]** I guess I just have to say, before we forget, your steam is done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:10]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:11]** That was done.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:12]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:13]** Cool.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:17]** So this Yusuke on the right-hand side now

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:20]** is going to come up that hallway and turn that corner.

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:22]** Did you have an action readied?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:24]** I did not have an action readied, though.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:25]** You did not?

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:25]** Great.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:27]** I didn't expect you to do this.

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:30]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:31]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:33]** Hey, what's up, guy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:35]** He doesn't give you a chance.

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:39]** He almost slides with his gun up, pulls the trigger.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:44]** That is a 14 to your KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:46]** I'm so sorry, but that doesn't hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:49]** And pulls a trigger, and it skims past your head.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:53]** It is now Tez Tronin's turn.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:58]** She is going to step out, see Rolu, and then step back in.

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:09]** And her actions, for the listener, not for Jon, she is going to move Vahri 13 out the door to the south.

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:11]** And that's the end of her turn.

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:12]** Thaddeus, what are you doing?

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:13]** I didn't hear anything.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:15]** Oh, great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:16]** Okay.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:27]** The bolt flies past Thaddeus' head and he just smirks with a kitty grin and then holds up with one hand his Venom Caster as if, like, you know, like, come on, that was pathetic.

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:30]** With an 18 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:31]** Of course that hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:33]** And for 11 damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:34]** Doesn't even matter.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:35]** He was already dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:37]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:44]** He's on the far edge of the map, so I have to slide over to kill him.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:45]** Cool.

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:48]** Okay, so he is dead and gone with one shot to the eyeball.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:54]** Thaddeus is going to start moving in the direction of the other Hisoki.

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:55]** He did hear that shot fired.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:56 - 00:51:03]** So he takes that shot, turns around, and starts to head west to meet up with Torme where the combat is actually happening.

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:04]** Surprise, surprise.

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:08]** Thaddeus is moving towards combat for the first time in this entire show.

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:09]** Wow.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:10]** 52 episodes.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:12]** It's the first time he's actually...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:13]** Going towards the line.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:18]** Man, three-fold's going to start soon, and all the murder-about-jokes are coming back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:22]** So, Trulu, it's your turn.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:23]** What are you going to do?

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:25]** It's a move action to get up, is that correct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:26]** It is correct.

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:28]** I am going to spend a move action to stand up.

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:32]** I'm going to loom over Jack.

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:36]** It's a little weed.

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:40]** And bring the dash code down on him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:41]** That's a good insult.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:47]** That's a great insult.

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:48]** That's a 24.

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:55]** Speaking of sick burn, that's a 24 against your EAC to deal 17 fire damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:57]** That's a sick burn.

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:59]** That's a sick burn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:01]** Oh, and it's a plant type, so it's not good at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:05]** I don't know if it necessarily has that.

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:09]** It's super effective.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:11]** We're doing Pokemon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:14]** Oh, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:16]** Ouch.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:17]** So that was your whole turn.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:18]** Did you take your bleed action?

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:19]** I did.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:20]** I took my bleeding.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:22]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:25]** Yeah, quick sidebar.

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:28]** I just downloaded the new Pokemon Scarlet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:29]** Diamond?

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:29]** Scarlet.

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:30]** Nice.

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:31]** Really enjoying it so far.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:32]** That's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:39]** Termay is going to run back.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:56]** I think seeing the Dashko fly after Chalk bravely attacking him, I think Jermaine is just going to level his Frostbite Zero class pistol and take a shot.

**[00:52:56 - 00:53:01]** Hit him in the back of the head with maybe a Dirty 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:03]** Oh, Dirty 20?

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:05]** Yeah, that'll hit my EAC.

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:07]** Boom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:09]** Little bit by little bit, wearing him down.

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:10]** Five points.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:11]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:14]** You mind if I... Yeah, yeah.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:14]** Go for it.

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:16]** Go right ahead.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:24]** You hit him in the back with a shot from your frostbite, and it does not seem to face him in the slightest.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:26]** In fact, it turns and says...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:30]** You know how cold it gets on Akaton at night?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:32]** I forgot about this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:36]** That was nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:38]** He's beastie.

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:41]** Very beastie.

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:43]** Doesn't even faze you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:46]** You have DR for cold, right?

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:48]** I certainly do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:51]** That's what that was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:55]** I should know that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:56]** Seems like you forgot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:53:57 - 00:54:00]** I'm a little dazed still.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:03]** Is that a racial trait?

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:04]** For Shabazz?

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:05]** Okay, nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:08]** I can unmake you.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:10]** No, I'm just kidding.

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:11]** I'd like to see you try.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:13]** All right, Termay, that was your whole turn or are you going to move still?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:17]** I'm going to move back through the doors, I think.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:19]** Are they closed or are they open?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:19]** They're open.

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:21]** I don't think you guys ever closed them.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:22]** Cool.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:22]** Rolo, you're up.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:23]** What's next?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:25]** What are you doing?

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:38]** So seeing Tez pop her head out and then pop back in, but then hearing Chalk get insulted and then hit for 17 points of damage, I think Rolo has a choice to make.

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:45]** And I have to say the last time that Rolo got upset at the person attacking Chalk, Jason, Rolo was a complete asshole, for lack of a better word, to that person.

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:46]** All right.

**[00:54:46 - 00:55:01]** Yeah, so, and I am just going to roll a wisdom check, and I got a nine, and I think Rolu is going to walk back around the corner, striding with purpose, and all four of Rolu's hands come up and pointed at Dotrulu.

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:02]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:15]** And Rolu is just going to, not even saying anything, is going to just start to conjure up images of the Kasathan homeworld as Rolu uses Dream of Home.

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:21]** And I draw on the magic of the Kasathan pillar of the homeworld, and I overwhelm you.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:34]** with pleasant visions of home, as if this fight is gone, as if you are in the safest place that you could possibly think of, and you need to make a will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:37]** Will save!

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:37]** Will save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:39]** I got a 15.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:41]** You got a 15.

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:43]** It was DC 14.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:47]** Oh, still fascinated for one round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:49]** God, I don't know what fascinated means.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:51]** I can't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:52]** Yeah, good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:53]** Move?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:54]** What is it again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:57]** I can't attack you, I don't think.

**[00:55:57 - 00:56:02]** I'm fascinated is that... Minus four to your skill checks.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:07]** You stand or sit quietly, taking no other actions other than to pay attention to the fascinating effect.

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:11]** So you can't do anything for one round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:14]** But if I get attacked, I think that breaks it.

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:16]** Any potential threat is a hostile creature.

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:18]** You can't even aim at me.

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:21]** You can't even aim.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:23]** So basically you lose a turn unless something happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:25]** Yes, unless someone tries to shoot me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:27]** What's this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:30]** Old mama...

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:34]** Go to lose fried kefek patties.

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:37]** The smell, it's overwhelming me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:43]** Chuck, you are up.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:44]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:46]** He's getting the Chuck out of there.

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:47]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:47]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:50]** Because, like, I was doing the math in my head.

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:55]** It was like, he's got reach, and I've got ranged weapons that are truly the most effective things.

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:59]** But, like, I can take a guarded step, but I'm still going to get an AoO anyway.

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:01]** So how am I going to navigate this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:02]** You can't take an AoO.

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:03]** He's fascinated, so you don't have to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:05]** Right, he's fascinated, so I can just run away.

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:08]** I'm going to run the fork away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:12]** I like the idea that chalk is a bad word.

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:16]** Get the chalk out of there.

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:16]** Chalk this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:17]** Yeah.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:18]** Starting to bleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:18]** Yeah.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:21]** But if we bleep it, they'll never know that chalk was a bad word.

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:22]** They'll just hear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:26]** We're going to go back and bleep all 52 episodes.

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:28]** Every time we say, thanks for volunteering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:30]** I appreciate that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:32]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:36]** So Chak is going to run over to Rolu's shoulder and climb up.

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:42]** But, like, he is visibly hurting.

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:52]** He's also going to ready an action to fire his Thasval Blaster once Dotrulu is not fascinated anymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:53]** Whew.

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:53]** Whew.

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:55]** That is the end of that round.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:57]** It is now, I think I'm keeping track, right?

**[00:57:57 - 00:57:58]** Round number four.

**[00:57:58 - 00:57:59]** It's Yusuke's turn.

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:01]** I believe the second Yusuke's dead.

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:02]** I need to just delete.

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:03]** Hold on, not delete.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:03]** Delete.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:04]** Get out.

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:04]** Delete.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:06]** Boom.

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:08]** The first Yusuke, though, is at the end of this hallway.

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:11]** He is, let's see if I can do this right.

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:12]** Oh, no.

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:13]** I just moved the whole map everywhere.

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:15]** I'm terrible with Roll20.

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:17]** I'm just terrible with computers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:18]** Dude, Kev, you're doing great.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:20]** You've been doing great for 52 episodes.

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:21]** I lost.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:22]** I didn't know where he went.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:23]** You got this, Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:26]** Believe in me.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:28]** Okay, so you are 75 feet away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:31]** I feel like the tide of this battle could go any direction.

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:32]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:40]** I don't know how hurt Dotrulu is, but they're fascinated for a second, and we're all kind of split up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:40 - 00:59:07]** so this Yusuke is going to run up to the door and he's got his eye on Thaddeus just out of range but when he gets to that door he's going to look up and he sees Treme and he's going to shoot Treme are you facing or turning away not that it matters for AC but just for story I was planning in my next move to place a booby trap so I'm facing I would see this happening

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:08]** Well, you see it happen.

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:11]** But, John, I'm going to need you to pull those cards back out.

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:12]** I rolled another natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:15]** This is the most that we've used.

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:15]** Yeah.

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:17]** The cards.

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:19]** The heart of the cards.

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:19]** All right.

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:20]** Let me know.

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:22]** Just did a quick shoe fool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:27]** I'm using my tiny little Kraken die, and I just looked over and saw this red blob, which is the Kraken.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:28]** Okay.

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:28]** Ready?

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:30]** You looking?

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:30]** I'm looking.

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:32]** Three, two, one.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:33]** Let's stop there.

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:34]** Okay.

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:36]** That is a ranged attack.

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:38]** Is it EAC or KAC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:39]** It is KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:42]** It is KAC.

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:43]** Crit effect...

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:47]** The attack has the line weapon special property.

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:49]** It's called follow fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:50]** Great.

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:55]** That means it shoots in a straight line and hits everybody in that line and there's nobody behind you.

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:56]** Did he reload?

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:58]** Because he had to use his move action.

**[00:59:58 - 00:59:58]** He did not!

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:02]** Rewind.

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:04]** Rewind.

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:07]** So he's just going to run up to the door as he's reloading and that's it.

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:11]** He draws his weapon and in his head he pulls the trigger and

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:14]** He looks so cool in his imagination.

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:16]** But you're right.

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:17]** He's reloading.

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:18]** Amazing.

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:18]** Cool.

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:20]** Tez, it's your turn.

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:21]** What are you going to do?

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:22]** Tez?

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:23]** I'm not quite sure.

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:24]** Kev's talking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:26]** Okay.

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:27]** Does Kevin usually do this?

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:30]** Kevin never does this.

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:31]** Okay.

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:31]** Okay.

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:31]** Good.

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:34]** I think something's broken in his brain.

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:35]** He's method.

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:35]** He's method.

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:36]** It's fine.

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:37]** Yeah.

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:37]** Good method.

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:38]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:00:38 - 01:01:08]** cool so Tez is going to actually just march over and stand right underneath that turret and pull Vahri 13 and put her put them in front of her so Vahri 13 Tez is right underneath the turret at that first intersection as you come into the stellar flare and Vahri 13 is standing right in front of Tez facing Rolo so Rolo you can kind of see this if you're looking back but I don't think you are I can yeah I can

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:09]** Cool.

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:10]** Thaddeus, what are you doing?

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:12]** What are you, what is your plans here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:16]** Thaddeus moves forward just in range of this Hisoki.

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:26]** And then he starts like laughing because he saw that guffaw right there or that whatever the word is for screw up.

**[01:01:26 - 01:01:28]** Starts coughing because it's too hilarious.

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:31]** And then takes the shot.

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:35]** Well, my magazine is almost full.

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:36]** Oh.

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:37]** This is only a 13.

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:39]** Against?

**[01:01:39 - 01:01:41]** Against KC, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:41]** That's a hit.

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:42]** That's a hit?

**[01:01:42 - 01:01:42]** That's what I'm saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:43 - 01:01:47]** Much to Thaddeus' surprise, he lands it with six damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:48]** Six damage.

**[01:01:48 - 01:01:48]** Okay.

**[01:01:48 - 01:01:49]** Do they go down?

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:50]** Are they done?

**[01:01:51 - 01:02:02]** He's got his gun up facing Torme, and then he gets shot just kind of right in the side with that needle, and it digs in deep enough that it took down half his life, but he's still up.

**[01:02:02 - 01:02:03]** He's still good.

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:07]** And it is now Dotrulu's turn.

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:08]** Oh, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:09]** It's...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:09 - 01:02:12]** And I remember, Ma, you.

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:17]** And then he takes the bleeding and it kind of snaps him out of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:17]** Yeah.

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:18]** That'll be my turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:19]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:19]** What?

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:19]** Oh, no.

**[01:02:20 - 01:02:23]** How dare you make me think about my dead mom?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:25]** Oh, God.

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:25]** Question.

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:27]** You may join us soon.

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:30]** At the beginning of your turn or the end of your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:33]** Oh, yes, you do take the bleeding at the beginning of your turn, huh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:34]** Does that count?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:34 - 01:02:35]** Does that stop the fascinated?


## Speaker_0

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:36]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:37 - 01:02:38]** I believe it would.

**[01:02:38 - 01:02:39]** Let's see.

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:40]** I don't know.

**[01:02:41 - 01:02:41]** It's tricky.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:48]** Hostile creature, any obvious threat such as somebody drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon automatically?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:49]** It's not an obvious threat.

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:50]** It's not a threat.

**[01:02:50 - 01:02:51]** I'm just bleeding.

**[01:02:51 - 01:02:53]** Yeah.

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:55]** I don't think he's threatened.

**[01:02:55 - 01:02:55]** Yeah.

**[01:02:56 - 01:02:56]** I don't even notice.

**[01:02:57 - 01:03:00]** Story-wise, he had knocked me out of it, but at the end of my turn, I would say it's fine.

**[01:03:00 - 01:03:01]** Right.

**[01:03:01 - 01:03:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:03:01 - 01:03:01]** Okay.

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:04]** Sounds... Yes!

**[01:03:04 - 01:03:05]** That's what happened.

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:06]** There it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:07 - 01:03:08]** Does that mean I get to shoot him now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:08]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:03:10 - 01:03:10]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:12]** Because you're ready to action.

**[01:03:13 - 01:03:14]** Shock ready to action.

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:14]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:17]** What was your action to ready if he was going to do anything?

**[01:03:17 - 01:03:19]** I was to shoot him once he was no longer fascinated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:03:20 - 01:03:21]** You're no longer fascinated.

**[01:03:22 - 01:03:22]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:22 - 01:03:23]** Is that a yes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:25]** That was a nod.

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:26]** Sorry.

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:28]** Nods don't work well for... No, they don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:28 - 01:03:30]** Cool.

**[01:03:30 - 01:03:31]** That's a seven.

**[01:03:31 - 01:03:32]** Oh, no.

**[01:03:32 - 01:03:34]** Seven to EAC, if that matters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:03:36 - 01:03:38]** Yeah.

**[01:03:39 - 01:03:39]** Cool, cool, cool.

**[01:03:39 - 01:03:41]** All right, Termay, it is your turn.

**[01:03:41 - 01:03:45]** You're up in the lab on the other side of those doors for the clean room.

**[01:03:45 - 01:03:46]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:59]** I think because this guy shot at me and I don't want him to trip a booby trap that I throw down, should the Trolloo come through this corridor, I think I'm going to shoot.

**[01:04:00 - 01:04:03]** I'm going to double attack.

**[01:04:03 - 01:04:03]** Nice.

**[01:04:03 - 01:04:04]** Just do it.

**[01:04:04 - 01:04:04]** Yeah.

**[01:04:05 - 01:04:07]** This Yosuke with the zero.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:04:07 - 01:04:08]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:08 - 01:04:09]** All right.

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:11]** 19 plus.

**[01:04:11 - 01:04:12]** That would be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:04:12 - 01:04:13]** Doesn't even matter.

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:13]** That hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:16]** That would be a 23.

**[01:04:16 - 01:04:17]** A 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:04:17 - 01:04:19]** A 19 and a 16 to hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:19 - 01:04:22]** I guess, so I'm double attacking, so it'd be minus four, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:04:23 - 01:04:23]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:23 - 01:04:27]** So it'd actually be a 15 and a 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:04:28 - 01:04:29]** Against EAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:30 - 01:04:30]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:04:30 - 01:04:31]** Those both hit.

**[01:04:31 - 01:04:32]** Nice.

**[01:04:32 - 01:04:34]** So roll your damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:34 - 01:04:38]** That's two plus four points on the first one.

**[01:04:39 - 01:04:40]** Nice.

**[01:04:41 - 01:04:42]** Okay.

**[01:04:42 - 01:04:44]** And five points on the second one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:04:45 - 01:04:46]** Oh, my God.

**[01:04:46 - 01:04:48]** So you see this guy slide out.

**[01:04:48 - 01:04:56]** He shoots at you, but then he pretends to shoot at you because he forgot to reload, and then he gets shot in the side, and you're like, nah, f*** this.

**[01:04:57 - 01:04:57]** Chalk.

**[01:04:57 - 01:04:58]** Sorry.

**[01:04:58 - 01:04:58]** Chalk this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[01:04:59 - 01:04:59]** Chalk this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:05:00 - 01:05:14]** You pull the trigger twice, and it hits him just... And every shot that hits him, because it's that zero frost, it just freezes over, and then you see his eyes glaze over as the cold digs into his heart, and he drops...

**[01:05:15 - 01:05:16]** Yes.

**[01:05:16 - 01:05:20]** So I'm moving back to the map and delete him off my Excel sheet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:05:21 - 01:05:22]** Nice shot to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:05:22 - 01:05:23]** All right.

**[01:05:23 - 01:05:24]** Rolu, you're up.

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:25]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:05:25 - 01:05:26]** Oh, man.

**[01:05:26 - 01:05:28]** This is... Yeah.

**[01:05:28 - 01:05:31]** Once again, you have been unfascinated.

**[01:05:31 - 01:05:32]** Chak is on your shoulder.

**[01:05:32 - 01:05:43]** But now, the worst fear of Vahri, who has become Rolu's friend, is start to come true as Vahri's life is in Tez Tronin's hands.

**[01:05:43 - 01:05:46]** I think... Let me check the range on this.

**[01:05:47 - 01:05:48]** Range of 100 feet.

**[01:05:48 - 01:05:54]** Rolu... Did Tez say anything, Kev, when she brought out...

**[01:05:54 - 01:05:55]** Vahri?

**[01:05:56 - 01:05:57]** Or did they say anything?

**[01:05:57 - 01:05:57]** Did Vahri say anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:05:57 - 01:05:58]** Vahri can't say anything.

**[01:05:59 - 01:06:04]** She's actually bound up and has tape over their mouth.

**[01:06:04 - 01:06:09]** And then Tez didn't say anything because she assumed you weren't looking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:06:09 - 01:06:11]** To be fair, I'm not looking.

**[01:06:12 - 01:06:15]** So I don't know that I would have noticed them.

**[01:06:16 - 01:06:18]** That's up to you.

**[01:06:18 - 01:06:18]** That's up to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:06:18 - 01:06:21]** If you really feel bad about it, you can roll a... I don't feel bad about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:06:22 - 01:06:35]** I'm just trying to play to the situation that's happening here, which is I think that Rolu turns back, sees Tez, and sees Vahri, and on a hope and a prayer...

**[01:06:35 - 01:06:38]** Rolu says, I don't have time to deal with you right now, Tez.

**[01:06:39 - 01:06:47]** And one hand reaches out and all of Rolu's fingers come together and Rolu is going to cast Hold Person on Tez Tronin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:06:47 - 01:06:49]** Oh, interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:06:49 - 01:06:49]** Yeah.

**[01:06:49 - 01:06:51]** You need to give me a DC 15.

**[01:06:53 - 01:06:54]** We'll save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:54 - 01:06:57]** We'll save!

**[01:06:57 - 01:06:58]** We'll save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:06:58 - 01:06:59]** Please fail.

**[01:06:59 - 01:07:00]** Please fail.

**[01:07:00 - 01:07:03]** Or else this is not as cool as it seems because it's actually a waste.

**[01:07:03 - 01:07:04]** That's a decent will.

**[01:07:04 - 01:07:04]** Please fail.

**[01:07:04 - 01:07:05]** Please fail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:07:05 - 01:07:06]** That's a 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:07:06 - 01:07:08]** Dude, you didn't have to do that.

**[01:07:08 - 01:07:09]** I asked you to fail.

**[01:07:09 - 01:07:11]** All right, that literally does nothing.

**[01:07:11 - 01:07:14]** Literally does nothing, as Tez probably laughs in my face.

**[01:07:16 - 01:07:17]** All right, cool.

**[01:07:17 - 01:07:20]** In that sense, that was Rolu's turn.

**[01:07:20 - 01:07:20]** That's it for now.

**[01:07:21 - 01:07:22]** Okay.

**[01:07:23 - 01:07:24]** Dang, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:07:25 - 01:07:26]** Chuck, what are you doing?

**[01:07:26 - 01:07:28]** You're again on Rolu's shoulder?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:28 - 01:07:33]** I am, and since he didn't move, I get to do a full round attack.

**[01:07:34 - 01:07:35]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:36 - 01:07:36]** That's fair.

**[01:07:37 - 01:07:44]** Now, I will probably say that since you ready an action, your initiative should be right after I go.

**[01:07:44 - 01:07:49]** So you don't get to basically go twice in one round by readying an action like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:07:49 - 01:07:52]** This is what always confuses me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:52 - 01:07:58]** Chuck is at the very end of... He basically paused until he could go again.

**[01:07:58 - 01:08:02]** And now his initiative count is right after me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:08:02 - 01:08:03]** Okay, yeah.

**[01:08:04 - 01:08:06]** So you're saying he should get the attack or no?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:06 - 01:08:07]** I'm saying no.

**[01:08:07 - 01:08:08]** He should not.

**[01:08:08 - 01:08:11]** You have to wait until I go again, basically, to get the goat.

**[01:08:13 - 01:08:14]** I'm not going to argue with you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:08:15 - 01:08:16]** I don't want to get shot again.

**[01:08:16 - 01:08:17]** I don't want to do that.

**[01:08:18 - 01:08:21]** So I'm moving Chak up to right after Dotrulu.

**[01:08:21 - 01:08:22]** And Rolu just went.

**[01:08:23 - 01:08:24]** So that is the end of that round.

**[01:08:24 - 01:08:25]** Okay.

**[01:08:26 - 01:08:28]** I'm still a little confused.

**[01:08:28 - 01:08:29]** I always get confused.

**[01:08:29 - 01:08:31]** Readying actions is weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:31 - 01:08:36]** So, like, I'm basically losing a round by taking half of my turn later?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:37 - 01:08:38]** Yeah, kind of, yeah.

**[01:08:38 - 01:08:39]** This is why I don't do it.

**[01:08:40 - 01:08:40]** Ever.

**[01:08:40 - 01:08:41]** Yeah.

**[01:08:41 - 01:08:42]** Ever.

**[01:08:42 - 01:08:44]** I mean, also, someone correct me if I'm wrong, of course.

**[01:08:44 - 01:08:44]** Sure.

**[01:08:45 - 01:08:47]** But I think you get moved to the end when you do the thing.

**[01:08:49 - 01:08:49]** Yep.

**[01:08:49 - 01:08:49]** Yeah.

**[01:08:49 - 01:08:50]** I think that makes sense.

**[01:08:50 - 01:08:51]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:51 - 01:08:54]** I would just expect to be able to take the rest of my turn at that point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:54 - 01:08:55]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:08:56 - 01:08:58]** I don't know.

**[01:08:58 - 01:09:00]** I'm going to rule in Jason's favor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:01 - 01:09:03]** You moved and then readied an action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:09:03 - 01:09:09]** Right, but then wouldn't he still have his turn now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:09:09 - 01:09:13]** No, I don't think so.

**[01:09:13 - 01:09:15]** I don't want to get too deep into ready action.

**[01:09:15 - 01:09:18]** I think whatever we want to say here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:09:18 - 01:09:20]** It is now round number five, I think.

**[01:09:20 - 01:09:21]** It might be six or seven.

**[01:09:21 - 01:09:21]** I don't know.

**[01:09:21 - 01:09:23]** I'm terrible with math and keeping track of things.

**[01:09:24 - 01:09:25]** It's Tez Tronin's turn.

**[01:09:26 - 01:09:27]** Tez Tronin's turn.

**[01:09:29 - 01:09:30]** She is down there holding Vahri 8.

**[01:09:30 - 01:09:34]** She did feel something from Rolu.

**[01:09:35 - 01:09:39]** She felt that grasp but was strong enough...

**[01:09:39 - 01:09:41]** in her mind to shake it off.

**[01:09:41 - 01:09:46]** And she's going to look at you and say, surrender now or the Android dies.

**[01:09:46 - 01:09:50]** And she's going to take, she's going to, I'm going to make it even more confusing.

**[01:09:50 - 01:09:53]** Ready in action to shoot Vari in the head.

**[01:09:53 - 01:09:57]** If you come after her.

**[01:09:57 - 01:10:05]** So if I move towards, if you shoot at us, if you make anything towards Tez and Vari, Tez is going to attack Vari.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[01:10:05 - 01:10:28]** the android so wait we can we can shoot your boss but not you is that is that what we're saying sorry i didn't i didn't hear you can can you say it again it was you're kind of far away all this gunfire is just it's ruining my hearing it's very loud yeah it's very loud sorry it rings in here because it's it's very tight space that that's a valid point but i i took my stance and i will stick with it what was that you took what


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:10:28 - 01:10:33]** I see your mouth moving and a gun to Varya's head, so I don't... What could that possibly mean?

**[01:10:34 - 01:10:34]** Who knows?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:10:35 - 01:10:36]** Are you scratching an itch?

**[01:10:36 - 01:10:37]** All right.

**[01:10:37 - 01:10:38]** Thaddeus, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:10:39 - 01:10:45]** Thaddeus is going to... He doesn't know what's going on down south of the hall, so he's going to try to make his way over there.

**[01:10:45 - 01:10:50]** Oh, he peeks around the corner and sees Trulu and stops just at the corner.

**[01:10:51 - 01:10:54]** He's like, okay, all right.

**[01:10:54 - 01:10:56]** Wrong hallway, sorry.

**[01:10:56 - 01:11:01]** He readies an action to shoot if he comes around the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:11:01 - 01:11:06]** So did you move and move back?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:11:07 - 01:11:08]** I mean, I don't know.

**[01:11:08 - 01:11:11]** I never really... Yeah, I guess I did.

**[01:11:12 - 01:11:13]** I don't know.

**[01:11:13 - 01:11:17]** I guess I was peeking around the corner, but I did not declare it ahead of time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:11:17 - 01:11:18]** No, that's fine.

**[01:11:18 - 01:11:20]** I'm just saying you're using two movements.

**[01:11:20 - 01:11:25]** You're moving one, and then you're moving again, but you're moving back to get your position.

**[01:11:25 - 01:11:29]** So you can't ready an action if you're using both movements.


## Speaker_0

**[01:11:29 - 01:11:29]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:11:29 - 01:11:32]** Just to make it simple so we're not dealing with readying actions.

**[01:11:33 - 01:11:34]** Dotrulu, you're up.

**[01:11:34 - 01:11:34]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:35 - 01:11:35]** Okay.

**[01:11:36 - 01:11:37]** All right.

**[01:11:37 - 01:11:41]** You guys are south of me very close, but then, I mean...

**[01:11:41 - 01:11:50]** I did put down a... The contract, you know, the right here is that once I kill Treme, the ship is mine.

**[01:11:50 - 01:12:05]** So I think he's just going to dust himself off a little bit and just with a shout just run forward into this lab towards Treme just so I'm just within reach.

**[01:12:05 - 01:12:06]** That's about as far as I can go.

**[01:12:08 - 01:12:10]** And bring down the dash code.

**[01:12:10 - 01:12:11]** One more time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:12:11 - 01:12:17]** So you're now standing in the clean room, transitioning into the lab.

**[01:12:18 - 01:12:22]** And Tremaine's just on the other side of that door, but technically 10 feet away.

**[01:12:23 - 01:12:23]** Are the doors open?

**[01:12:24 - 01:12:25]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:26 - 01:12:29]** I didn't get a chance to do the booby trap in there either.

**[01:12:29 - 01:12:30]** Okay, great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:30 - 01:12:34]** I only got a 15 against your EAC.

**[01:12:34 - 01:12:36]** How's that going to do?

**[01:12:36 - 01:12:39]** I'm rolling very high on all this damage.

**[01:12:39 - 01:12:40]** That's another 17.

**[01:12:40 - 01:12:45]** The third maximum damage that I've done these two fights.

**[01:12:46 - 01:12:47]** I guess I'm sorry.

**[01:12:47 - 01:12:50]** I'm close to down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[01:12:52 - 01:12:54]** Why don't you fall down already?

**[01:12:54 - 01:12:57]** Because I have the will to live.

**[01:12:57 - 01:13:00]** Unlike you, apparently.

**[01:13:00 - 01:13:02]** I bleed a little bit more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:13:04 - 01:13:07]** I bleed in him.

**[01:13:07 - 01:13:08]** Spit in his face.

**[01:13:08 - 01:13:10]** That's actually an Akeshi move.

**[01:13:11 - 01:13:12]** Chak, you're up.

**[01:13:12 - 01:13:12]** What are you doing?

**[01:13:12 - 01:13:17]** Chak is going to turn to Rulu and say, hey, which way are we going, dude?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:13:17 - 01:13:23]** I think we have to face Dolshulu and have the leverage in this fight against to save Valerie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:23 - 01:13:23]** Cool.

**[01:13:23 - 01:13:27]** I'm going to fiddle with your initiative yet again and delay until after Rulu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:13:27 - 01:13:28]** All right.

**[01:13:28 - 01:13:29]** Oh, my God.

**[01:13:29 - 01:13:30]** You guys are killing me.

**[01:13:30 - 01:13:31]** Torme, you're up.

**[01:13:31 - 01:13:32]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:13:31 - 01:13:53]** uh i'm gonna take a guarded step back out of the reach and uh cast my final wall of steam around him yeah encircling him yeah and steam you can see it rise all right uh do you want to draw the circle did you draw the circle i didn't draw the circle no but just like we can play it just


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:13:53 - 01:13:55]** Okay, so it's just pretty much that entire room.

**[01:13:57 - 01:13:59]** The entire airlock room just fills with steam.

**[01:14:00 - 01:14:00]** Wow.

**[01:14:00 - 01:14:02]** And you're going to take 3d4 damage now.

**[01:14:03 - 01:14:03]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:14:04 - 01:14:05]** I like a nice schvitz.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[01:14:07 - 01:14:12]** I heard you like steam showers, so maybe you'll enjoy this.

**[01:14:12 - 01:14:14]** Ten points of damage.

**[01:14:15 - 01:14:15]** Okay.

**[01:14:15 - 01:14:17]** You must be getting close now, big guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:14:18 - 01:14:19]** That's your turn or are you going to move?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:14:20 - 01:14:21]** I took that guard and stepped back.

**[01:14:21 - 01:14:22]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:14:22 - 01:14:23]** Sorry, I missed that.

**[01:14:24 - 01:14:24]** Cool.

**[01:14:24 - 01:14:25]** Rolu, you're up.

**[01:14:25 - 01:14:26]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:14:26 - 01:14:30]** Rolu says, stay strong, Vahri.

**[01:14:31 - 01:14:34]** And then whispers to Shaq, I think we can call Tess's bluff.

**[01:14:34 - 01:14:36]** Let's take out the Trulu.

**[01:14:36 - 01:14:45]** And Rolu is going to move up 15 feet to help take out the Trulu.

**[01:14:45 - 01:14:53]** I'm moving 30 feet to stand in between the two doorways where we fought those crazy apparitions.

**[01:14:53 - 01:15:00]** And then I'm going to lower my rifle and look down the sight.

**[01:15:01 - 01:15:06]** And that is a 20 against EAC as I shoot Dojo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:15:06 - 01:15:10]** Although I am in a bunch of steam, so there's a chance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:15:10 - 01:15:13]** Oh, and we haven't been playing your concealment this entire time.

**[01:15:13 - 01:15:14]** Well, I haven't had it.

**[01:15:14 - 01:15:18]** Well, John, or sorry, Rolu does not have night vision.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:15:20 - 01:15:22]** Well, concealment doesn't stack, so it's just the higher whichever one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:15:22 - 01:15:23]** It's dim light, right.

**[01:15:24 - 01:15:26]** Oh, because the dim light's been in, right, throughout the hallways.

**[01:15:27 - 01:15:28]** It's okay.

**[01:15:28 - 01:15:30]** We haven't been playing with any, just lights came back on mysteriously.

**[01:15:32 - 01:15:33]** That's fine.


## Speaker_0

**[01:15:33 - 01:15:33]** Hey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:15:33 - 01:15:35]** Well, I got a 77, so it's above 20.

**[01:15:36 - 01:15:36]** So we're good.

**[01:15:37 - 01:15:39]** Yeah, it was a 20 against.

**[01:15:39 - 01:15:40]** That'll hit me.

**[01:15:40 - 01:15:41]** Okay.

**[01:15:41 - 01:15:44]** And as Vinny said, where's a D4 when you need one?

**[01:15:46 - 01:15:48]** You know, it's all good.

**[01:15:48 - 01:15:49]** I found one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:15:49 - 01:15:51]** Cool, cool, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:15:51 - 01:15:55]** Yeah, hopefully you're getting low here, Dotrulu.

**[01:15:55 - 01:15:59]** That is going to be... To the window, to the wall.


## Speaker_0

**[01:15:59 - 01:15:59]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:16:00 - 01:16:04]** to the window, to the wall, to the 10 points of fire damage against Rulu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:04 - 01:16:07]** Till the sweat drops down your storm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:16:08 - 01:16:09]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:16:11 - 01:16:13]** You just kind of, you're seeing his through the steam.

**[01:16:13 - 01:16:13]** Yeah.

**[01:16:13 - 01:16:17]** You're just seeing his, his, his massive frame through the steam.

**[01:16:17 - 01:16:18]** You're not sure what's going on.

**[01:16:18 - 01:16:21]** If you've heard him too much or.

**[01:16:22 - 01:16:22]** Okay.

**[01:16:22 - 01:16:22]** Okay.

**[01:16:22 - 01:16:23]** All right.

**[01:16:23 - 01:16:24]** That's Rulu's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:16:24 - 01:16:26]** That is the end of that round.

**[01:16:27 - 01:16:27]** No, it's not.

**[01:16:27 - 01:16:28]** We're into the next round.

**[01:16:28 - 01:16:30]** But now Chuck's going to go.

**[01:16:30 - 01:16:32]** Chuck went after Doe Trulio, I thought, didn't he?

**[01:16:32 - 01:16:34]** No, no, no, but then he moved his initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:34 - 01:16:35]** Delayed until after Rolo.

**[01:16:36 - 01:16:37]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:16:37 - 01:16:39]** Kev's loving this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:16:40 - 01:16:43]** Okay, I moved it down again.

**[01:16:43 - 01:16:46]** I have an idea for an app, an initiative tracker that works.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:50 - 01:16:55]** I'm going to have to figure out how many times I can move in the initiative order in a battle just to mess with Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:16:57 - 01:16:57]** You've done it.

**[01:16:57 - 01:17:00]** Get it in while you can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:00 - 01:17:01]** Uh, let's see how far away you are.

**[01:17:01 - 01:17:05]** Uh, I am here and you are there.

**[01:17:05 - 01:17:07]** Uh, screw it.

**[01:17:07 - 01:17:10]** I'm going to try to shoot you with my light.

**[01:17:10 - 01:17:11]** That's all blaster.

**[01:17:12 - 01:17:13]** I don't imagine this will go well.

**[01:17:15 - 01:17:15]** Whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:17:15 - 01:17:15]** Let's find out.

**[01:17:16 - 01:17:17]** Take that concealment too.


## Speaker_0

**[01:17:17 - 01:17:17]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:17:17 - 01:17:18]** Yeah, 20%.

**[01:17:18 - 01:17:19]** A bunch of smoke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:20 - 01:17:21]** A big smoke show.

**[01:17:22 - 01:17:24]** That is a five to hit.

**[01:17:25 - 01:17:25]** Oh, boy.

**[01:17:25 - 01:17:26]** Yeah.

**[01:17:26 - 01:17:26]** Cool.

**[01:17:27 - 01:17:27]** That's it.

**[01:17:27 - 01:17:29]** Just shooting off into the ether.

**[01:17:30 - 01:17:30]** Okay.

**[01:17:30 - 01:17:30]** That's all.

**[01:17:31 - 01:17:31]** All right.

**[01:17:31 - 01:17:32]** Thank you, Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:17:32 - 01:17:36]** Did anybody else have something held or readied or whatever?

**[01:17:36 - 01:17:37]** Can we move on?

**[01:17:38 - 01:17:38]** Yes.

**[01:17:39 - 01:17:40]** I believe it's round number six.

**[01:17:41 - 01:17:43]** Top of the round is Tez Tronin's turn.

**[01:17:44 - 01:17:47]** And you guys are far enough away that you can't see what is going on.

**[01:17:47 - 01:17:47]** Oh, man.

**[01:17:48 - 01:17:53]** But for the listener, Tez Tronin, she hears...

**[01:17:53 - 01:17:56]** all the battle, you know, the gunfire and everything else.

**[01:17:57 - 01:18:03]** She recognizes that, like, she doesn't hear the small pistol fire from her ads, right?

**[01:18:03 - 01:18:03]** Is that right?

**[01:18:03 - 01:18:05]** Is that right?

**[01:18:05 - 01:18:05]** Her troopers.

**[01:18:06 - 01:18:12]** And she knows Dotru Luka's either going to handle it himself or go down fighting.

**[01:18:12 - 01:18:15]** It's not her fight at this point.

**[01:18:16 - 01:18:19]** She has what she needs, and she's going to start backing out.

**[01:18:20 - 01:18:21]** And again, none of you know that.

**[01:18:22 - 01:18:23]** But she steps out.

**[01:18:24 - 01:18:27]** She drags Varya 13 back out of the Stellar Flare.

**[01:18:27 - 01:18:29]** It's now Thaddeus' turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:18:30 - 01:18:31]** Thaddeus moves to the corner.

**[01:18:32 - 01:18:37]** He's catty corner of Dotrulu now, and he joins the volley of gunfire.

**[01:18:37 - 01:18:40]** Totally surrounded, Dotrulu is now.

**[01:18:40 - 01:18:41]** Let's hope we can finish this off.

**[01:18:42 - 01:18:46]** That's a 21 to attack, and I'll roll the missed chance.

**[01:18:47 - 01:18:53]** It's 52, so I think I'm good for... Oops, that's the wrong attack roll.

**[01:18:53 - 01:18:54]** I'm sorry.

**[01:18:54 - 01:18:56]** I'm sorry, the wrong damage roll, I should say.

**[01:18:57 - 01:18:58]** For 12 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:18:59 - 01:19:01]** Ouch.

**[01:19:01 - 01:19:02]** Just coming in there.

**[01:19:03 - 01:19:03]** You're definitely hitting him.

**[01:19:04 - 01:19:06]** By a thousand cuts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:19:06 - 01:19:11]** And I don't know if it's the steam and you guys just can't see.

**[01:19:11 - 01:19:14]** I don't know whether he's up or he's down.

**[01:19:15 - 01:19:19]** But he's taken a lot of damage and it's now his turn.

**[01:19:19 - 01:19:22]** Dotrulu, Jason Keeley, what is going on?

**[01:19:22 - 01:19:32]** Well, you'll be happy to know that you managed to knock me to zero hit points with that steam and have just been riddling me with bullets this entire time.

**[01:19:32 - 01:19:38]** However, showbads have something called showbad ferocity, which means I get to act one more round.

**[01:19:39 - 01:19:40]** Oh, man.

**[01:19:40 - 01:19:43]** And he emerges from the steam towards Treme.

**[01:19:43 - 01:19:45]** It takes another 3d4.

**[01:19:45 - 01:19:46]** That doesn't matter.

**[01:19:46 - 01:19:49]** It doesn't matter at this point how much sandwich I take.

**[01:19:49 - 01:19:54]** Just scorched, battered, bruised, full of bullet wounds and whatever you guys are shooting at him.

**[01:19:54 - 01:20:03]** just barely on his feet, raises the dashku and takes a attack.

**[01:20:04 - 01:20:05]** Why did this get to me?

**[01:20:06 - 01:20:08]** Here we go.

**[01:20:09 - 01:20:16]** It's a 15 against the AC, which I believe we have said that does hit.

**[01:20:16 - 01:20:18]** 13 fire damage.

**[01:20:20 - 01:20:20]** I'm down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:20:20 - 01:20:22]** Crash!

**[01:20:22 - 01:20:22]** Oh my god!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:20:23 - 01:20:24]** And then he dies.

**[01:20:24 - 01:20:26]** It's a double KO.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:20:27 - 01:20:30]** Oh my god.

**[01:20:31 - 01:20:37]** So Dotrulu comes out of the steam just like his armor is falling off of him.

**[01:20:37 - 01:20:40]** That skull armor he had on him is just broken into pieces.

**[01:20:41 - 01:20:44]** His body is burnt and is riddled with bullets.

**[01:20:44 - 01:20:46]** He slashes at Treme.

**[01:20:46 - 01:20:52]** Treme falls to the ground and then this giant beast topples down on top of him.

**[01:20:53 - 01:20:56]** It almost echoes through all the halls.

**[01:20:56 - 01:20:58]** And that's our.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[01:20:58 - 01:21:02]** Oh, I knew it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:21:03 - 01:21:04]** Oh, Lord.

**[01:21:05 - 01:21:12]** What I love is that Chak and Thaddeus and Ralu just don't even like see or hear anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:21:12 - 01:21:19]** As he knocks Termaidan out, the steam dissipates and all we see are their two unconscious bodies next to each other.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:21:29 - 01:21:32]** Thanks for listening, you scallywags.

**[01:21:33 - 01:21:38]** Until next week, drift beegons and distant stars.
