## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:00:01 - 00:00:13]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:13]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:15]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:17]** Get out.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:20]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:22]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:23 - 00:00:30]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales of the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:33]** Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:00:56 - 00:01:01]** All right, welcome back to We'll Save and the Inner Stellar Tales from the Extra Galactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:01:02 - 00:01:02]** I am Kevin Decker.

**[00:01:03 - 00:01:06]** I am your host for Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:07 - 00:01:08]** Unknown Treasures!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:08 - 00:01:09]** Hey, Kevin.

**[00:01:10 - 00:01:11]** That was so fast.

**[00:01:11 - 00:01:12]** It was like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:12 - 00:01:18]** It's like running a race.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:19 - 00:01:21]** You got to stay on your feet and keep going.

**[00:01:21 - 00:01:25]** Otherwise, you're going to trip and fall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:25 - 00:01:25]** Correct.

**[00:01:26 - 00:01:26]** Cool.

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:27]** Cool.

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:28]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:29 - 00:01:29]** That's all I got.

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:30]** That's it.

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:31]** That's it.

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:31]** End of the show.

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:32]** All right, everybody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:32 - 00:01:34]** I'm going to cue the ending music now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:35 - 00:01:38]** All right.

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:40]** I have questions of the week and stuff.

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:44]** I have a question, but it's very Starfinder related, so I didn't want to jump too quick into that.

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:47]** Is anything going on in anybody's lives?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:47 - 00:02:04]** no um i mean there's something going in someone's life oh vinny what's up man i've just i've been getting into smoking meats a lot oh yeah yeah did a brisket last week that turned out pretty well that's great dude i just got coloring meats

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:34]** no this is not coloring meats this is this is you're 32 again right yeah yeah that's what i've heard once you hit your 30s it's either world war ii history or smoking meats oh yeah i went to i went to world war ii history yeah you got to get into one of them that's perfect so kev kev can be our historian and i'll make dinner that sounds good you know i'm excited i just got a um killer hogs rub from the store today and i'm going to start a pork after we're done for dinner tomorrow


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:35]** Nice.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:40]** You have that grill that has those little pellets or something, right?

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:41]** Yes.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:42]** You and Will both have Traeger's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:44]** Dude, Traeger pellet grills.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:46]** I ate some stuff off from that.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:47]** It was amazing.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:48]** Anyway, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:53]** So like, let me tell you when you're doing a long smoke, like a brisket, cause those cook for like 18 hours.

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:55]** So you're doing it overnight at some point.

**[00:02:56 - 00:03:03]** So like filled it up to the brim with pellets, went to sleep, set my alarm for like three to make sure it was fine.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:07]** And I'd only burned through maybe like an inch or two of pellets.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:13]** Like I very easily, and I won't ever get up in the middle of the night again, just cause like it's rock solid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:14]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:22]** I love my trigger and fill it up before I go to sleep, wake up the next morning and, and you know, we're eight hours along in the cook and I've done nothing.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:23]** It's the best.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:24]** Nice.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:26]** Sounds great, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:26]** Yeah.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:26]** Wow.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:40]** Well, and there's like, there are these really nice like offset smokers where you've got a whole firebox on the side or you can put in like actual sticks of dried wood and those impart a whole lot more complex smoke flavor and,

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:43]** But at the end of the day, I'm working.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:44]** I've got two kids.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:45]** I've got a wife.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:50]** It's not really something I can tend to all night long and be functional the next day.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:52]** So yeah, Pella Grill for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:54]** Sounds good.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:54]** Amazing.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:55]** I think...

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:59]** I am, I don't know, I'm kind of doubting your spirit here.

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:02]** I'm thinking that you're not committing as hard as you could.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:07]** That's really what it feels like to be a real barbecue enthusiast.

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:14]** You know, stay up for 18 hours the whole night and monitor by hand their cooks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:16]** And just finish a third of a bottle of something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:22]** I mean, yeah, maybe this pellet grill is a gateway drug to real offset smokers.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:25]** I think so, dude.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:30]** Show up to the next episode with bags under my eyes, but a plate full of meat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:34]** Can we get sponsored by those grills?

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:36]** Does Traeger make those?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:41]** Dude, Traeger makes... Oh, we should get sponsored by... Yo, Traeger, holler at your boy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:44]** Just another company on the list.

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:46]** I Wi-Fi-er all the time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:50]** At our live shows, we'll offer smoked meats.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:53]** Oh man, we should do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:56]** We should participate with food trucks or people who do smokers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:59]** When we tour, we will tour with a Traeger.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:00]** There you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:07]** Although, I think part of the terms of use for a Traeger is that you cannot professionally cook for it.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:10]** So we have to give it away if we were to do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:14]** That's fine.

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:22]** If Traeger sponsors us, we'll have free smoked meats at our store.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:26]** So step one of this plan is to get Traeger to sponsor us.

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:27]** Step three, profit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:30]** Step three is profit.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:31]** No, that's step four.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:32]** Step three, we don't know yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:34]** We're not going to divulge what it is.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:35]** Only we know.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:37]** And then we profit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:39]** We'll save live, fired by Traeger.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:41]** Fire by Traeger.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:42]** That sounds good.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:47]** Just another company on the list of companies that don't sponsor us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:50]** We've got three lists of sponsors so far.

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:57]** Sponsors we want, sponsors we can't ever get, and sponsors we don't want.

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:59]** I think Hyundai was on that list of we don't want.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:01]** I think Sprite also.

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:02]** Wait, who?

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:03]** I forget why we didn't want Sprite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:05]** Atlassian.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:05]** Atlassian.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:06]** Atlassian.

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:08]** Atlassian.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:10]** Not sponsored by Atlassian.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:11]** Blacklist.

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:13]** Why not Sprite?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:16]** Because I like Sprite.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:18]** I'm not sure why.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:20]** Because we're edging for Dr. Pepper instead.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:20]** Was that why?

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:22]** Aren't they all owned by Coke?

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:23]** Yeah.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:25]** I'm still confused on that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:27]** No, Dr. Pepper is independent, I thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:27]** Kind of.

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:32]** Yeah, they're like bottled by Pepsi and Coke, depending on what region they're in.

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:33]** It's very strange.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:35]** Okay.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:35]** I'm okay.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:36]** You're okay with Sprite?

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:40]** I'm okay with not being sponsored by Sprite or Dr. Pepper.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:40]** With not?

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:45]** What about if you did get a sponsor from either one, which one would you prefer?

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:47]** It's a very clear answer.

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:48]** Dr. Pepper.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:49]** Okay.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:50]** Yeah, that's obvious.

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:52]** I shouldn't even have to ask that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:57]** What you didn't see was, you didn't see Kevin lift his Dr. Pepper bottle and point to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:58]** I just finished it.

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:01]** Now that it's finished, I'd like to talk about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:05]** This is why video is so important, because we can just have silent product placement.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:09]** And it's just Kev with a two liter of Dr. Pepper in his shot behind him.

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:11]** Dr. Pepper tattooed across my forehead.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:12]** Yeah, and you just never say it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:18]** He takes a key, pops the bottom, and just shotguns the whole thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:22]** Sounds terrible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:24]** I don't know why you would ever do that.

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:27]** You would do that because you need to stay up all night because you're a real smoker.

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:28]** Please don't do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:30]** If you're at home, don't shotgun soda.

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:32]** There's no reason for that.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:33]** No, there's not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:37]** Unless you're putting it on YouTube, then sure.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:39]** That sounds good.

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:41]** Can we get sponsored by Johnny Walker?

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:41]** That'd be cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:46]** I'd prefer other manufacturers.

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:49]** I prefer different scotches.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:50]** I'll take Johnny Walker.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:51]** I'll take whatever.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:55]** I'm down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:56]** Chivas Regal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:56 - 00:08:22]** oh yeah yeah no okay i i think i'm kind of in the category of like i'm not too i don't i'm not too picky on which sponsors we get as long as it's not atlassian why not hyundai again and like no terribly immoral things i feel like we should do cigarettes yeah i don't want any more immoral things yeah no yeah yeah not really down with cigarettes yeah yeah yeah to beers yeah like man


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:24]** Definitely not De Beers.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:26]** Don't buy your diamonds.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:28]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:29]** Kay Jewelers.

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:32]** We should cut all of this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:35]** Every kafok begins with Kay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:39]** Every kafok begins with Kay.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:44]** Now we can't cut it, Will, because that was a good bit.

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:46]** So, sorry, dude.

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:47]** We can't cut it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:50]** That's always the standard whenever we're editing.

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:50]** I know.

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:59]** If we could make a joke that's related to Starfinder somewhere down the line, in our rambling introductions, we might do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:01]** What we could do is bleep all the big ones.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:06]** You could bleep ****** or ******.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:09]** We don't want them to take us down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:10]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:11]** Yeah.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:11]** Yeah.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:12]** This will be a fun conversation to listen to.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:16]** It's just bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep.


## Speaker_0

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:17]** Anyways.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:18]** You're in that same realm.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:21]** We'll bleep them too.

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:23]** Not Dr. Pepper though.

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:24]** You can't bleep Dr. Pepper.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:25]** No, you can't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:33]** Speaking of amoral things in the universe, here's my first question that is Starfinder related.

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:38]** I'm just kind of inching you towards gameplay because I love gameplay.

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:41]** I've been craving gameplay since the last time I recorded.

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:49]** My question for you, though, is as a player...

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:52]** but also as your player characters.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:55]** So as your player, I want to know what's your favorite planet in Starfinder.

**[00:09:57 - 00:10:04]** And then as a player character, I'd like to know what's your favorite planet that you have been to or that you want to like most visit.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:07]** So I guess I could kind of start on that one.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:10]** I wrote up a whole long list of stuff.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:16]** My thing is I know, I think like I know so much about Akitan because it's,

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:16]** that's where Rick is from.

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:19]** So I didn't do a lot of research for, for 19.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:23]** Um, but running this game, unknown treasures, it takes place almost entirely on Akita.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:35]** And I had to do a lot of research for that, but I have to say that my favorite planet, uh, out of every, all the planets that I know of in the, in packed worlds and so on, I think Castroville is my favorite.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:38]** I think it's, what words did I use when I wrote this down?

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:40]** Cause my, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:42]** Why is it your favorite?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:43]** It's lush.

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:44]** It's diverse.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:47]** It's inviting, but it also wants to kill you.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:49]** The whole planet is like a giant Venus flytrap.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:51]** It's space Australia.

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:53]** Those are the words that I... Yeah.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:54]** Interesting.

**[00:10:54 - 00:11:00]** The last thing I was going to say about Akaton, it reminds me a little too much about my hometown, San Bernardino.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:02]** San Bernardino is a town?

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:03]** Yeah.

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:06]** I don't know if I remember.

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:07]** It's a county and a city.

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:09]** Like Jacksonville.

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:10]** But it's my hometown.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:12]** I don't know.

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:14]** I never thought about Castroville and San Bernardino.

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:18]** I would not have put them in the same... No, not Castroville.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:18]** Akiton.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:19]** Oh, Akiton.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:24]** Yeah, the desert trash planet of the United States.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:31]** I recently saw somebody wants to secede San Bernardino County from California.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:31]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:32]** Yeah, that happens all the time.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:34]** That's amazing.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:35]** That's good stuff.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:36]** That's good stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:36]** It's hilarious.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:37]** Hilarious.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:38]** Good luck with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:45]** I think like 90% of the population of San Bernardino is in like the bottom left-hand corner of San Bernardino County, which is San Bernardino City.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:48]** The rest is just open, empty desert all the way to Nevada.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:49]** Yeah.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:51]** Except for like Joshua Tree, Palm Springs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:52]** That's open, empty desert.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:53]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:54]** It's a fairly low count.

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:55]** Anyways, who's next?

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:59]** Yeah, I was going to say, just for the listeners, though, tell us your favorite planet.

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:10]** And if you want to learn more about any of these planets, you can pick up Packed Worlds, Near Space, or you can even build your own planet using the Galaxy Exploration Manual, which is phenomenal.

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:11]** Yep.

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:12]** Pretty sweet.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:13]** Nice plug.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:13]** Cool.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:13]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:14]** Let's go around the room.

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:16]** John, what's your favorite planet?

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:17]** Oh man, this is hard.

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:19]** I have three answers to this.

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:26]** My favorite planet naming system is the VESC naming system for near space book.

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:35]** How they're just like, so just like VESC one or sorry, VESC prime, then VESC two, three, four, five, six, seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:38]** Like that's the George Foreman approach.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:39]** The George Martin approach.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:40]** It's great.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:50]** I think the strangest, my favorite strangest planet is probably Abalon because I just have not seen anything in any book so far.

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:54]** And I try, like, I try to like maybe sometimes read adventures.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:54]** Yeah.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:59]** that Paizo's put out for Starfinder, but also sometimes I don't want to, because then I'm like, what if I play?

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:01]** Like, I don't want to know all about it.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:06]** And just in the ones that I've read and in the boards, I just haven't seen a lot of published adventures with Avalon.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:09]** And it just seems like the one that is the most

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:28]** maybe foreign because it's just all inhabited by like uh like cybernetic androids robots like the whole world is like governed by that like i don't even know where to begin conceiving that and then the my favorite planet overall is probably either leovara or uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:45]** because they're just just neat they're just like cloud cities cloud planets you know i'm gonna make a hard assumption right now on rolu though is i'm gonna guess his favorite quote-unquote planet would be the adari you are absolutely correct and he also wants to get back to the adari or just the


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:47]** get to the Atari 2.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:49]** Oh, 2.

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:50]** Okay, I thought he's been there.

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:51]** No, he's never been.

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:53]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:54]** He'll have to wait and see.

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:59]** I hope he makes it, but I don't know if we know that he won't.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:02]** Well, maybe he will.

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:03]** We'll find out.

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:04]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:05]** Stay tuned.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:06]** Spoiler alert.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:07]** Stay tuned.

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:08]** Well, thanks for the spoiler, Kelly.

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:11]** Why don't you tell us a little bit more about...

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:14]** What's your favorite planet?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:16]** And then also, what is Thaddeus' favorite planet?

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:18]** Wait, was it you that mentioned Castorvel, Kevin?

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:19]** Was that you a second ago?

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:20]** I did, yeah.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:22]** Castorvel is fun.

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:23]** It does look pretty nice.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:24]** It looks like the most hospitable planet.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:26]** I don't know.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:30]** I'm just going to say Vesk 6 because that's where... I picked a random number.

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:32]** No, no, that's actually where Thaddeus is from.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:35]** That's where the cat people in this universe departure from.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:36]** Cool, okay.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:44]** It's like a planet full of, like, jungles and stuff, and they send them out as little younglings to go and fight and kill each other and, you know, stuff like that.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:46]** Only the strong survive.

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:47]** Yeah, kind of like that, yeah.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:48]** So...

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:49]** Katniss Everdeen.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:51]** Ancient Sparta.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:52]** It's a little bit like that.

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:53]** It's charming.

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:57]** And then, what was your question regarding... More like Lord of the Flies.

**[00:14:58 - 00:14:59]** It's slightly like that, actually.

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:02]** What was your question about Thaddeus?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:06]** I'm going to assume now that his is also Vesk 6.

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:08]** What's his favorite planet?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:10]** Yeah, it's Vesk 6.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:10]** There you go.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:13]** Thaddeus isn't the most...

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:14]** Original.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:19]** Thaddeus has been to many, many, many, many, many planets in his adventures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:22]** And yet, he still chooses.

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:23]** He's a taste for home.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:24]** They're cats.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:25]** Come on.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:26]** They are cats.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:27]** They don't like to travel.

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:29]** Yeah, that's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:32]** Will, you said I'd be disappointed in your pick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:43]** Well, okay, so first of all, let me just say that when you asked that I prepare for this question, you did not mention that you wanted my personal favorite as long with my character.

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:45]** Yeah, you had another question that you had us prepare.

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:47]** You had a different question in mind.

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:48]** But that's fine.

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:49]** I didn't prepare for either one.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:50]** No, I'm just kidding.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:51]** I did.

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:52]** It's all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:55]** Just for the listener, I didn't say, hey, I want to know.

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:56]** I think I just said, like,

**[00:15:57 - 00:15:59]** Learn about some planets and pick one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:59 - 00:15:59]** Uh-huh.

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:00]** Yeah.

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:02]** No, you didn't have very pointed questions.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:03]** It's fine.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:04]** Yeah.

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:14]** So personally, I would say my favorite planet would be Pabak because I really am into Dr.

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:15]** O.K.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:17]** 's home planet and his backstory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:18]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:23]** And I like the idea of a planet being tamed by slugs.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:25]** You know, love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:27]** It's just like holes in all the vegetation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:28]** Yeah.

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:42]** I mean, there's like a wild, you know, there's like, you know, it's kind of like a Castroville in a way where it's, it's dangerous in parts, but you know, the, the cities are well defended by drone army created by slugs.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:43]** Come on.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:45]** Who doesn't want that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:48]** I'm just imagining how gross the main highways would be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:49]** Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:51]** Yeah.

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:54]** Yeah, well, you know, gets a little slimy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:55 - 00:17:03]** Will, in their ruder and more elementary state, did these slug beans, did they ever, like, use, like, little snail shells and things like that?

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:04]** I would assume.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:05]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:06]** Yeah.

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:08]** I mean, that was probably pre-Gap, right?

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:10]** Yeah, a long, long time ago.

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:11]** Probably.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:12]** Pathfinder times.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:13]** Yeah, and the Pathfinder 2E times.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:14]** Yeah.

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:18]** But Termay's favorite planet is... Sairun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:19]** Tell us about Sairun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:23]** It's a planet that I'm from.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:26]** And that's all I can really say about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:28]** That's all he's willing to say about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:31]** Sairun.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:31]** Sairun.

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:32]** Yeah.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:33]** You can look it up.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:36]** You won't find anything.

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:36]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:38]** Witch Warper is very mysterious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:44]** Little is known of Sairun, and that's the way we like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:45]** I love it.

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:49]** I'm sorry for throwing you guys all such a hard question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:52]** I like the other question that you asked.

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:54]** What was the other question?

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:55]** The one that you were going to ask.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:57]** Well, don't spoil it.

**[00:17:57 - 00:18:01]** I made a list of potential questions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:09]** We should share potential questions because I also have a list of questions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:32]** no those are yours john i don't want your questions all right cool man yeah and the spirit of collaboration and the potential questions i gave you were all the questions i had on my mind so um cool it's hard to do this every week yeah yeah it is i'm like what is the question we haven't covered yet well i want to know i want to know vinny's planets yeah we'll get there we're getting there music stopped for vinny


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:32 - 00:19:00]** um so chak is a raxalite raxal is dope um imagine like caribbean resort but the entire planet um that's cool love but that's awesome he and i are a bit more curious about near space um so i i imagine if you were to look in his quarters which i expect is like a shoebox right because he's tiny um

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:23]** um you would see like polaroid pictures of the cloud giant breathita um nice he he's fascinated by like barathus and um the confluence like how all of that works and you know he really wants to meet a breathita one day he's never been but he would like to go


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:25]** That's super cool.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:34]** In our test game, Myrax got to meet a Brathu and had an interesting conversation with them.

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:35]** Yes, that was fun.

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:36]** Cool.

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:39]** Well, all that said...

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:46]** So many planets in this universe, and yet we're stuck on Akiton.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:48]** Desert wasteland with no shade.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:49]** Very true.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:50]** Yeah, no shade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:52]** It's a very hospitable climate.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:54]** Shade is forbidden.

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:55]** So great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:56 - 00:20:00]** So speaking of having no shade and being stuck in the desert, I'm going to take you over to the map.

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:01]** I love it.

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:02]** To the map!

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:03]** to them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:04]** It's like being in San Bernardino.

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:08]** It's like being in San Bernardino.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:09]** Oh my god.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:09]** Amazing.

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:11]** All the junk everywhere.

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:12]** It's great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:14]** Lots to do.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:15]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:18]** Let me just give you a short rundown of what happened last time.

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:28]** After rescuing Vary 13 from the Thestarian Cathak, they joined you as you started your way back through the car yards.

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:29]** Coyotes.

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:30]** Coyotes.

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:31]** Coyotes.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:36]** You all make it through the scrap slide with no problem except for Rolu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:37]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:37]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:37]** Yep.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:39]** Stumbled through, took a cut.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:44]** And then I put you in initiative orders because you were coming up on those K'vok nests.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:46]** I mostly did it so you guys could try to sneak by.

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:50]** And it didn't do a very good job because at the end, one K'vok saw Treme.

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:55]** And I know Treme had the highest stealth.

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:58]** but he's wearing bright orange clothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:58 - 00:20:59]** I'm not wearing bright orange.

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:02]** It's burnt orange and black.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:02]** Okay, burnt orange.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:05]** One would argue that blends in the most, Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:07]** Against metal?

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:08]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:10]** Aren't those the city colors of San Bernardino?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:11]** That's true.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:12]** Burnt.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:14]** It's mostly just burnt, not even burnt orange.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:16]** It's burnt orange, man.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:17]** Yeah.

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:21]** I really just had to see something and you were the only one in sight.

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:25]** But the rest of the team made enough of a ruckus trying to get past.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:35]** My biggest question for now is will you stay and fight or are you guys going to race across this toxic river?

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:45]** And just for the listener, we have Thaddeus is already on that bridge of, you know, ragged, what's the word?

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:45]** Corrugated.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:46]** Corrugated steel.

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:47]** Yeah.

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:49]** Plates that are making this bridge.

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:51]** He's already halfway across that bridge.

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:51]** Yep.

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:52]** Want to get out.

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:58]** Vahri 13, Rolu, and Chak are at the start of that bridge.

**[00:21:58 - 00:22:02]** Chak's actually on a little stone island that's starting to support or helping to support it.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:13]** And then we have Termay is back between the two pyramid-like ziggurats facing off against K'vok number two.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:16]** And initiative order...

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:19]** It is actually Termay's turn.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:20]** Do we need battle music?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:22]** I say we book it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:26]** I think that is up to Termay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:27]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:28]** What do we need?

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:30]** Whether or not we need battle music?

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:30]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:35]** I mean, why don't we leave and cover Aria?

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:36]** Termay, hurry!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:38]** Yes, I will hurry.

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:42]** I'm going to double move.

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:45]** And I've calculated...

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:50]** That if I do that, then I can actually get past you.

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:52]** I appreciate the descriptiveness to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:56]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:57 - 00:22:58]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:58 - 00:23:02]** I'd say that's like 1.5 inches too far to me, but it's cool.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:04]** Yeah, I'm going to go short.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:05]** I'm going to go short.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:10]** So basically you can get all the way past one leg, two legs.

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:11]** Wait, can you rewind?

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:12]** Just hit the third dog leg.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:16]** You said you're doing two moves, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:18]** Yeah, double move.

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:21]** Can you do one move at a time for me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:22]** Okay.

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:23]** Uh-oh.

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:25]** Kevin.

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:26]** Oh, no.

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:28]** And I still have my environmental protections.

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:30]** Just in case another boss warns.

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:32]** So we're going to call it right here.

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:33]** Which one?

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:33]** You're asking me?

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:35]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:35]** You tell me.

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:38]** No, just do the full thing.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:38]** Okay.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:39]** Yeah, I'm just going to do right here.

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:40]** All right.

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:43]** And as you do that.

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:44]** Uh-oh.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:44]** Uh-oh.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:45]** Don't you dare.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:52]** You step down almost right next to where Thaddeus is standing on this corrugated steel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:55]** Kevin, there had better not be a monster in this swamp, Kevin.

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:56]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:58]** I think he's going to say that.

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:02]** You can't have two people on the same spot.

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:04]** Well, we're not, but go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:09]** Treme and Thaddeus are close enough that their combined weights cause the shift just enough.

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:14]** And the stack of seats above you rumble.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:17]** I'm going to need you to do a reflex save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:20]** Can I pause my movement?

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:26]** And seeing this, can I use Psychokinetic Hand to shift it back in like Jenga?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:26]** No.

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:29]** No, I'm not going to give you a reaction to this.

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:32]** This is, yeah, this is... Okay, because you're just trying to run out.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:33]** Yeah.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:43]** So, your combined weight on the makeshift metal bridge causes the seats to topple, which crushes any character on its path and possibly pushes them into the chemical spill.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:44]** I got an 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:45]** My God, Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:46]** 16.

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:46]** Oh, right.

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:47]** 16.

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:48]** Gross.

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:48]** F***.

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:52]** Ah, keep a distance.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:53]** F***.

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:59]** Okay, so if you would have failed, you would have pushed 10 feet into the chemical spill.

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:00]** Oh, my God.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:04]** Since you passed, it is 2d6 of damage, but you get half of that.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:06]** Oh, nice.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:06]** Go on.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:07]** No.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:09]** Splash from all this.

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:12]** So you both take four points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:13]** Oh, you rolled it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:14]** Yeah, I rolled it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:36]** sorry but i take half of that you take i rolled an eight i rolled eight so i rolled two fours okay well let's keep in mind that thaddeus is a cat and therefore very lightweight potentially can i can i move can i continue my movement you can continue your movement wait but uh is it is that gonna cause another issue because we're so close again

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:37]** What's your initiative?

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:39]** I don't know.

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:42]** But, like, Kevin, if he walks past, do we know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:43]** Do you want to do an engineering check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:44]** Yeah, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:46]** I'll give you a free engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:47]** I don't have engineering.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:50]** Someone else do, please.

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:50]** I do.

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:51]** Tomei, what do you think?

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:56]** Can we continue to be so close with all this junk?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:56 - 00:26:02]** Will the 17 get me any information on this pile of rubble above us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:13]** Yeah, I'll say with that high of a check, you would know that everything that's toppled over is pretty stable now, which is completely disappointing for me.

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:25]** But you would also know that if you would have just taken a little bit of time before crossing this thing, you probably could have shored that up and prevented it with the same DC engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:28]** Yeah, but then I'd be in the path of the Kvark.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:30]** That's possible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:31]** How is it?

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:32]** Is it stable?


## Speaker_0

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:32]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:35]** Yes, it appears to be stable now.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:37]** It's settled after this.

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:44]** Apologies for the intrusion towards your personal safety.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:46]** No, get to safety to me.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:47]** We're on our way out.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:52]** Yes, I'm going to make the most of my movement to here.

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:54]** Hurry along, everyone.

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:55]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:57]** That is the end of Treme's turn.

**[00:26:57 - 00:27:03]** He's now almost three quarters of the way along this bridge after knocking down half that wall.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:05]** It is now Thaddeus' turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:13]** Well, Thaddeus is going to move twice, like Jermaine.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:17]** Actually, he may just need to move once, which he will do right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:19]** Nah, nah, nah, nah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:21]** Which he will do right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:23]** Like, right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:25]** Make sure you use the Q to do the path.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:26]** Yeah, you're right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:27]** Roll 20 tip.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:28]** Hot tip.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:31]** Thaddeus will go to here right now.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:33]** He's on the edge.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:34]** Right meow.

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:34]** Right meow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:39]** So Thaddeus tiptoes across the entire bridge and makes it to the end.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:40]** And then the sand opens up.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:41]** He is on firm ground.

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:46]** There are 14 K'foks standing there with baseball bats in hand.

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:48]** You can't control this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:53]** When I DM, Kevin, you will see what will happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:55]** 14 K'foks.

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:58]** I'm just going to roll a d20 and see how many creatures I spawn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:58 - 00:27:59]** You're the wrong part of town.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:02]** Snapping their fingers in unison.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:07]** He's more scared of the Hilkies, to be honest, after they just baton him over and over and over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:10]** No one comes into San Bernardino without us.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:14]** None.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:15]** Man.

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:16]** All right.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:26]** It is actually now Fari13's turn, and they are going to delay their turn until Rollercoaster.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:26]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:27]** Why?

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:27]** Okay.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:28]** Interesting.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:29]** That's weird to me.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:30]** Maybe she's like a mage or something.

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:35]** Maybe she's got a thingy for these two foxes.


## Speaker_0

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:35]** That'd be cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:40]** Yeah, they actually are just kind of like insecure, you know, and kind of nervous.

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:44]** And so they're comforted by Rolo's presence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:47]** Do they do anything for Rolo to know this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:49]** I mean, it's within six seconds.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:52]** Yeah, they would kind of step back and just watch what you're doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:54]** Oh, like turn and look.

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:54]** Okay.

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:55]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:56]** Got it.

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:56]** Yeah.

**[00:28:56 - 00:29:01]** Which I guess makes sense because it is now Rulu's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:01]** Okay.

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:03]** I think Rulu is going to sense.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:05]** Would I need to roll anything to sense that?

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:07]** Or is that just noticeable?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:08]** I think it would be pretty apparent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:08]** Yeah.

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:09]** Okay.

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:14]** I think Rulu's going to look and say, you have a will of confidence within yourself.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:16]** Let me lead you there.

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:21]** And Rulu's going to step past Vahri and is going to start moving.

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:27]** Let me do the Q-tip approach.

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:31]** So I can get to about halfway through maybe the second leg with my first 30 feet.

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:44]** And then I think I want to like, I wish I could just delay there and wait, but I'm only going to move that far.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:46]** I'm only going to move the first 30 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:48]** And you're going to then just give up your second turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:52]** Yeah, well, I have my gun trained.

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:55]** So that was my move.

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:57]** I'm actually going to do, let me see.

**[00:29:57 - 00:30:01]** Can I do, what action do I want to do?

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:04]** I want to turn around and make sure that Vari and Shaq are okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:14]** So I'm thinking... So you did a move action, and now you're on the bridge where the... or standing on all the rubble from the fallen seats.

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:17]** Are you talking about doing herring fire or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:19]** Yeah, I was thinking about doing covering fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:21]** You can do covering fire.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:24]** You don't see one in line of sight currently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:24]** Oh, okay.

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:26]** Well, then I'm not going to...

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:27]** I can shoot.

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:28]** There's no one there.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:34]** But maybe I can do a... I can use my standard action to... Can I ready an action?

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:35]** You can.

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:38]** I believe it also moves you in initiative order.

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:39]** That's fine.

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:41]** I will ready an action then.

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:50]** If a K'fok comes around the corner, then Rulu's going to take a shot with his rifle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:53]** And so as you do that, almost like...

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:56]** you could feel it like a, like a shadow on you.

**[00:30:56 - 00:31:02]** Um, but as soon as you started moving, Vari 13 trailed right behind you.

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:03]** Oh, good.

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:03]** Okay.

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:09]** And they are going to end up on this bridge, which would have triggered it and caused a nice fall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:12]** Except we already triggered it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:14]** Do you want to take a moment of silence, Kev?

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:15]** Yeah.

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:16]** Go to silence for a misstop.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:17]** It's like dreams.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:22]** It's a hurt one of us more with this.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:22]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:28]** This whole area is disgusting.

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:31]** Yeah, and you guys are just like, I dodged it.

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:33]** Moving on.

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:33]** Great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:36]** Why do you think I always feel that way whenever something cool happens?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:38]** We just don't appreciate it.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:40]** Yeah, it's just totally unappreciated.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:45]** Because then it would have been like, oh, they're in the acid, they're dying, and we save them.

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:48]** I thought we had environmental protections.

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:52]** No, environmental protections do not protect you against acid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:53 - 00:32:00]** Kev is the old man in Saw, and he's upset that the people he trapped don't appreciate his games.


## Speaker_0

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:02]** No!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:27]** exactly but that being said speak speaking games i i i do find that when i'm playing now that i've gm before and maybe you will do this too kev i don't go looking for like the like i'm not gonna willingly put myself in the way of these things but i am a little more okay with like taking a risk right for certain things because i'm like let's just like have fun if if something crazy happens then something crazy happens you know


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:28]** Yeah.

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:30]** Except for if it happens in your game, you kill us immediately.

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:34]** So, um, but have I done that yet?

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:34]** It's gotten close.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:36]** Um, yeah.

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:39]** Anyways, I might, who knows?

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:41]** Maybe I'll roll a dice and you guys fall off anyways.

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:44]** Cause I'm the GM.

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:46]** So you get to roll the random earthquake table.

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:47]** Your turn.


## Speaker_0

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:47]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:48 - 00:33:02]** So as Vahri steps close to Rolu, you actually see a K'vok come out of... Come out of very 13.

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:04]** What?

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:06]** Come out of very 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:12]** It's three K'voks with a trench coat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:15]** Go ahead and roll me a perception check.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:15]** Who?

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:16]** Chak.

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:20]** Or I'll give Rolo a perception check too since he was looking back that way.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:22]** Ooh, not good.

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:23]** Chak.

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:23]** 10.

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:24]** 10.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:25]** 15 for Rolo.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:26]** Oh, that's actually probably enough.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:30]** So let me move this one and I'll move this one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:33]** Did three just show up?

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:34]** They were.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:37]** Three crooks in the trench coat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:39]** I'm so glad I just ran away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:42]** And it actually wasn't any of their turns.

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:45]** It was this one over here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:46]** A fourth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:56]** The fourth one comes down and it is actually almost in a sprint or whatever you consider what a sprint is for these things.

**[00:33:56 - 00:34:00]** All its legs, they are completely flat and not running along the ground.

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:06]** And they come up and they stop because they heard the hissing and the humming from these other K'Vox.

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:12]** And it stands up and that's as far as it can get on its turn.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:13]** Roll is going to take a shot.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:16]** Oh, because you had... Ready to action.

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:17]** Ready to action.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:17]** Okay.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:18]** Yeah, this first one here.

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:20]** Go ahead and roll.

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:21]** Okay.

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:23]** Is that within your range of your weapon?

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:24]** That's your question.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:26]** About 40 feet out, it looks like.

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:26]** 44?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:27]** That was just a wild guess.

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:29]** That was a good guess.

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:32]** Yeah, it's a range of 100 feet for the azimuth serpent laser.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:33]** Pew!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:35]** That's...

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:36]** A natural 20.

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:38]** Nice.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:40]** Yeah.

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:43]** All right.

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:43]** Well done.

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:45]** Thank you.

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:45]** Cool.

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:49]** I will roll twice and add my bonus both times.

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:51]** That's what I'm going to do.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:52]** 10 points of damage.

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:53]** Yes.

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:54]** On that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:56]** Is that a one-hit kill or close to it maybe?

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:58]** Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:03]** So, asthma serpent laser, is that what you said?

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:04]** Yes.

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:08]** This thing... What does a gun look like?

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:09]** I don't even know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:12]** It literally looks... Looks like a snake?

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:19]** Yeah, the barrel has, like, the curve of a body, and then I think the muzzle is, like, the mouth of the snake.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:20]** Snake.

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:20]** Yeah.

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:25]** So that just, you know, the mouth lights up, and you see the teeth kind of glowing through, and it...

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:31]** And it just pierces right through this thing.

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:38]** It stands up and just like its chest goes hollow and it flops right back down to the ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:40]** So nice.

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:41]** I got shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:41 - 00:36:06]** in the head that's too good while that's happening Chalk can see that there are two other K'Fox and he saw Tremei's eyes lock down that aisle between the two Ziggurats and probably understands there's a third so there are still three K'Fox on the play here and Chalk is alone in the back luckily it's your turn what do you do


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:09]** Man, you bullseyed that one, Brad, didn't you?

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:18]** Jack is going to seeing all of this danger.

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:20]** I'm actually...

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:22]** I might be more wary of Vari 13.

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:25]** I'm suspicious of why she's tailing so close to Rolu.

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:27]** Can I roll a sense motive on why?

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:28]** Oh, nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:31]** Is it called a sense motive?

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:32]** Is that what the word is?

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:33]** Yeah.

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:33]** I forget.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:35]** Yeah, it is.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:36]** Do I counter?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:40]** Detect deception or sense mental effect?

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:42]** I guess I would roll a bluff against that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:43]** If she was trying to hide something, yeah.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:45]** Are you going to roll a bluff?


## Speaker_0

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:46]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:50]** Or if there was something that, yeah, you want her to not show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:51]** Okay.

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:54]** Go ahead and roll your sense motive, and I'll tell you what they say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:55]** Twelve.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:58]** I'm going to say you can't sense anything either way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:58 - 00:36:58]** All right, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:01]** It seems very genuine, Kurt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:02]** Awesome.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:06]** Then I'm going to scurry over to Rolu and climb up on her shoulder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:07]** And as you do that...

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:09]** Is that your whole turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:09]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:11]** What does it take to get on to?

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:12]** Is that an action?

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:13]** I think it's a move action.

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:13]** To climb someone's shoulder?

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:14]** I effectively double moved.

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:15]** Yeah.

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:15]** Okay.

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:17]** Okay.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:17]** Cool.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:19]** That is the end of your turn.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:20]** Oh, man.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:28]** It is now the K'fok that saw Torme is going to actually come down to there.

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:31]** And then, let's see.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:32]** Where is this?

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:37]** So it comes in between the two pyramid things.

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:39]** And then let me measure.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:39]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:40]** Thank you.

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:42]** Just seeing how far it can move.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:48]** It's actually going to move to here, right where chalk was.

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:49]** Oh, man.

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:53]** It scurries across that bridge and it stops right there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:55]** What a cool scene.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:59]** And that is the end of round number three.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:07]** Understanding this round's a little bit, you know, stretched out because we got into initiative order for, like, tracking purposes.

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:08]** But we're into round four.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:12]** It is Kefauk five's turn.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:13]** Sorry, is it five?

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:14]** Four.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:15]** I had it written down wrong.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:18]** So this one is going to come down...

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:29]** Climb off of the ziggurat and move over to that, on top of that barrel-looking thing on the coast of the river.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:31]** Oh, man.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:32]** It is then the other K'Fox turn.

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:39]** That one is going to run along the cliff edge of the river.

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:40]** What?

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:40]** !

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:48]** and then come down and join the second Kafak on the little island of that first set of corrugated steel.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:49]** Oh, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:53]** The way off of this, we cannot go back.

**[00:38:53 - 00:39:03]** We're just being pressured forward by two Kafaks here, and then there's another one that could conceivably cut us off by going around the floating barrels on the other side of this river.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:07]** Yeah, so exactly where you are currently...

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:10]** Thaddeus is at the other side of the river.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:11]** Yeah.

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:13]** Torme is almost there.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:25]** And then the other three of you are standing really tight together in the area that did topple only 10 feet away from two K'voks.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:29]** And there's a third K'vok on the edge of that river.

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:30]** Oh, man.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:31]** So it is now Torme's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:34]** Uh, Treme's got no spells.

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:36]** He's low on health.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:47]** Uh, he is going to seeing these, you know, he does a quick glance back and then all of a sudden he sees like three fox crossing the bridge.

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:53]** Can I do an engineering check to see if I can collapse part of this bridge using my psychokinetic hand?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:59]** I'm going to say without even... You can only lift one bulk with your psychokinetic hand.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:09]** Right, but I'm just saying I could pull out one bulk, like the linchpin of... You're going to have to ace... I want a natural 20 in order for that to... Might as well do it.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:12]** Is that my engineering check?

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:19]** All I'm saying is you would probably know that it's almost impossible to do that with just telekinetic hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:19]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:22]** But if you roll natural 20, I'll give it to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:25]** No, I don't think it's too low odds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:27]** You don't have anything to lose by rolling, right?

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:29]** I know, but I could shoot at them.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:30]** Well, that's your turn.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:31]** Yeah, that's your action.

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:31]** And then move.

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:32]** Oh, that's your action.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:35]** I thought it was a free action, but I guess I'm wrong.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:36]** It's casting a spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:41]** Yeah, using a skill check that has an effect is usually your action.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:42]** My bad, my bad.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:44]** I was being silly.

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:53]** Like, even an intimidate is technically an action if you are using it to, like, change somebody's... Right, if I'm manipulating, but if I'm surveying, it's kind of like a free action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:54]** Wait, I have a question.

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:56]** Kevin, how much does the fox weigh?

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:57]** Sorry, Kevin.

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:58]** Man, I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:58 - 00:41:00]** Do they weigh one bulk by chance?

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:29]** they weigh 14 pounds two of them weigh one bulk just lift the fox into like the acid just lift him into the acid why can't he I don't know I'm not sure if that's true or not Kevin you just made the greatest mistake by admitting that and real quick it might be something like you get a grapple check or something against it right I mean I imagine there's like a magical limitation against moving living beings with it I don't know


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:29]** Really?

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:31]** I mean... It says object.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:33]** It doesn't say... Oh.

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:35]** Ah, jeez.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:35]** It's so lame.

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:40]** You can't perform complex actions such as firing a gun or using a computer, so I'm going to say that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:43]** I know, I know.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:45]** I'll let you push it, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:47]** Yeah, you can push it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:48]** Tap it on the shoulder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:49]** Okay, push it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:51]** I don't know.

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:53]** Do what you want to do.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:54]** No, no, no, no, no.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:55]** I... What you going to do?

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:59]** Tickle its chin.

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:23]** I'm out of spells I can't do any cool things so I'm just gonna shoot and move the old SNM now you all know how here's feels when he runs out of spells man sucks yeah say how much something weighs in there like feels bad yeah so I'm gonna I'm gonna attack it I have my azimuth laser pistol out it's not much but it'll but it's honest work it'll do something

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:24]** Okay, which one are you attacking?

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:25]** There's three on this bridge.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:29]** The one closest to me, just across, nearest to Bari.

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:30]** Nice.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:32]** Oh, does a 20 do it?

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:35]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:36]** Not a natural 20, though.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:37]** Dirty 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:39]** Dirty 20 definitely hits, yes.

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:39]** Yeah.

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:42]** I was about to get a static for you and I had to pause.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:44]** So five points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:46]** Oh, close.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:48]** So bam, you shoot this thing.

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:55]** It takes off an arm and pierces through its skin, but you see that it's still up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:57]** Okay.

**[00:42:57 - 00:43:01]** So I'm going to now move the Remainer.

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:07]** Of the distance next to... I'm going to try and be tactical about it.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:10]** I'm going to go here.

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:15]** And that way, if this other one scurries across the barrels, I'll have a good shot.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:20]** And I can also get good line on the other ones.

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:21]** Maybe we can flank them.

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:22]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:37]** So for the listener, Terme moved all the way to the end of the bridge and to the shore of the other side of this river of acid to cut off any flanking these K'foks might try to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:38]** Yeah.

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:41]** Guys, hurry up.

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:43]** We got to get out of here.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:46]** I don't want to deal with these K'foks.

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:49]** But looks like we gots to... Mother kafakas.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:52]** Mother kafakas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:54]** Hey, don't forget that we have Look Alive.

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:57]** So if you've got it on your... Are you like... Oh, wait.

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:58]** What does Look Alive do?

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:02]** Plus two to perception and initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:05]** We haven't really used any of that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:07]** We had perception earlier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:10]** Yeah, and you saw everything that would have been there.

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:12]** Thanks for pointing that out, though, John.

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:13]** Keep that in mind for later.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:15]** It is now Thaddeus' turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:18]** Their movement speed is 30.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:18]** Is that right?

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:21]** That's what I've observed, but just double-checking.

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:23]** I'll roll 30.

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:23]** Okay.

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:34]** And Thaddeus wants to find out if he thinks that this Kefauk can take this route here over these barrels by jumping over instead of going the more secure route.

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:36]** Can you find that out?

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:36]** Say again?

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:45]** Thaddeus wants to know if this Kefauk here can jump this way and take this path down this purple thing.

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:46]** Is this purple thing navigable?

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:47]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:47]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:48]** for him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:52]** So you drew a purple line last time talking about paths that you could possibly take.

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:55]** You're asking if this Kafak could take that route.

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:59]** I'm going to tell you that you presume that it could.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:04]** You don't think it would be easy and it would probably take them a while.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:07]** It might be fraught with danger for them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:09]** Okay.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:11]** Thaddeus is, uh, gonna shout.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:20]** We should probably go west through where the Tire Dragon thankfully wasn't, because there's more Kefauk down dead south, and we should avoid them.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:22]** We don't want to be flanked.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:28]** Um, so you're just gonna shout that and be like, let's run and maintain a distance and clip them on our way out.

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:36]** And he's gonna shoot the one that, uh, Tirmay shot, and, uh, that's, um, a, uh...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:54]** uh no it's like it's only an 11 to hit so i guess only an 11. yeah that is a miss unless unless wait that is uh kac right oh hold on i rolled incorrectly no no no oh oh no never mind i did actually correctly


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:56]** Uh, it's, it's, it's bad.

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:57]** Yeah.

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:58]** It's Casey.

**[00:45:58 - 00:45:59]** Is it EAC or Casey?

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:00]** Cause it's here, which I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:02]** It's like long.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:05]** It's well, but it's just a long energy damage.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:06]** Autotarget rifle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:07]** Kinetic to connect damage.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:07]** Oh, it'd be kinetic.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:08]** That's a miss.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:08]** Yeah.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:11]** You should turn on that auto feature.

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:12]** It might've helped.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:13]** That's true.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:13]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:14]** It might've been cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:15]** Is that your full turn?

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:16]** Why are you getting attacked twice?

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:20]** Well, I guess you couldn't have, and you have to get an S4.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:44]** yeah i'll do it a minus four can you retro can either it didn't it's technically a full action to do it didn't land anyway neither one so you just shot twice yeah okay um cool it is now uh rolu's turn is it because i moved because i did ready action and i went after the kafaq


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:48]** You went after the other K'vok.

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:49]** The one that I killed.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:50]** Yeah.

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:57]** And then Vahri was technically before you, but they delayed, so they are after you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:58 - 00:46:58]** Okay.

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:08]** I'm going to delay and... Why did Vahri delay again?

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:10]** Okay.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:10]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:14]** I think Rolu's going to... They didn't delay again.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:17]** They delayed last time, and now they are below you in initiative order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:28]** Okay, then Rolu's going to delay until after Vare's turn, and he's going to say, you're much safer in front of me, between me and Thaddeus and Torme.

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:31]** So he's going to wait until Vahri moves past him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:34]** Okay, so you are delaying until after Vahri moves.

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:34]** Correct.

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:35]** Okay.

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:47]** And he's paralyzed with fear, and it's not going to... They are going to look back at the Tuca Fox, look at Rolu, nod, and actually run past you.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:52]** And at this point, they are going to take kind of your...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:52 - 00:48:12]** um almost approval to keep going and they are going to continue to the end of the bridge excellent and get off okay the bridge and they are now on the other side it is now rolu's turn rolu is going to jack are you ready to get off this ride here always ready to get off

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:26]** Okay, I can make it almost... I think Rulu just starts moving, expecting you that you're going to finish that statement, and you don't.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:34]** Rulu's going to run to almost off of the metal, the corrugated metal at the other end.

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:40]** And I think Rulu's going to cast...

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:42]** Vanishing trick.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:49]** Is this metal that I was standing on, is that about one bulk?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:50]** I'll say that...

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:53]** I'll give you like a section that's five foot.

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:54]** Okay.

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:55]** So five feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:55]** Okay.

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:57]** I'm going to make five foot square of this stuff.

**[00:48:58 - 00:49:03]** I'm going to make, I want to essentially make that panel invisible.

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:08]** So to convince the, to make the Fox think that they can't pass.

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:09]** What is your range on this?

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:11]** Uh, it was a great question.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:13]** Maybe I would have cast it as, as a,

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:14]** Maybe I wouldn't have moved as far.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:15]** It's a cantrip, right?

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:16]** It's a cantrip.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:18]** Ooh, it's ranged touch.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:22]** So what I would have done is touched it, sorry, then ran away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:24]** Just hold on a second, Chalk.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:28]** You reach down, tap the bottom, and he freaks out because it vanishes below.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:29]** Is there a save or anything for that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:31]** It's kind of cool.

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:34]** There is a will negate.

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:36]** If you're trying to vanish.

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:37]** Saving throw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:38]** Will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:41]** Yeah, it's probably because it's an illusion.

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:48]** So I would need to look, but it could be like you would need to do a will save and I would tell you the DC.

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:51]** And if you pass the DC, then that's if we're attempting to see it.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:56]** If you're attempting to see whether it's the illusion is fake or real.

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:57]** Okay.

**[00:49:57 - 00:49:57]** Yeah.

**[00:49:57 - 00:49:58]** Nice.

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:01]** And that is the end of your turn.

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:02]** That's the end of my turn.

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:03]** And Chuck, you stayed on my shoulder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:04]** I did.

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:04]** Okay.

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:05]** All right.

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:07]** So that's Rolu's turn.

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:13]** So the Kafak that's on the barrels is going to move over.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:19]** And you see it kind of like clenches its claws into the top of this barrel.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:25]** And as it does that, you notice that there's a lot of these tick marks on the side.

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:27]** It seems like these things do it a lot.

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:28]** And it starts actually kind of tapping.

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:34]** And then it's going to be the other Kafak's turn.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:38]** As it runs over to where the bridge vanished.

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:39]** Uh-huh.

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:42]** And it's going to do a will save.

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:43]** DC 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:43]** Will save!

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:45]** Will save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:47]** Will save!

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:47]** Will save.

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:49]** Will save.

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:50]** It looks at it.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:51]** Yeah.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:53]** And it does exactly like the other one was doing.

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:55]** It digs its claws down.

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:56]** Uh-huh.

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:58]** Except for it notices...

**[00:50:58 - 00:51:08]** that it doesn't go down, and it taps again where the vanished spot is, and it's actually going to cross.

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:08]** Boom.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:12]** And it's actually going to stop there and tap again.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:15]** And then the other kafak is going to follow it.

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:21]** And while it does that, another kafak appears out of the dust.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:22]** What?

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:23]** Oh, my God.

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:24]** How many are there?

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:25]** Good Lord.

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:28]** It's N plus one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:31]** N plus one.

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:32]** N squared.

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:34]** It's Chalk's turn.

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:35]** So go ahead, Chalk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:42]** I've been doing some reading in between last turn and this one.

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:46]** Chuck has one bit of tech that you probably didn't expect him to bring.

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:50]** What would it take to bring this bridge down?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:54]** Tell me what you intend to do first, and I'll tell you how feasible it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:56]** Chuck has a breaching charge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:57]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:58 - 00:52:26]** oh yeah so i i originally intended it sort of like how brick shows up with a hand grenade and in uh anchorman oh my god just has a preaching charge amazing escalated quickly so like with that in theory like would chuck know whether or not that's enough to cut off this method of entry for the fox to isolate them to one path


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:28]** Yeah, I think, like, not even engineering.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:33]** Like, this is fairly unstable corrugated steel.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:36]** Especially where you're standing now, it's very high.

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:39]** It's actually almost 10 feet down.

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:46]** And it's just this corrugated piece of steel between where the rubble was that fell and this stone pillar.

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:50]** And then the next set of corrugated steel to the other ledge of this river.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:53]** Oh, man.

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:55]** I've chosen very poorly.

**[00:52:55 - 00:53:00]** I think the other part of this...

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:03]** Calculus is it's an engineering check to set the charge.

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:06]** Jack is untrained in engineering.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:08]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:10]** You do know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:15]** So check on his turn taps.

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:17]** Hey, hey, boss.

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:18]** Would this help?

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:21]** And he pulls out the breaching charge and shows it to him.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:28]** And that's that's my that's the other half of my action because I use my move action to stay on his shoulder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:31]** Okay, so that is your turn.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:42]** So, current situation, Thaddeus, Torme, and Varya13 are on the opposite edge away from the Kafak Nests.

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:58]** with chalk on his shoulder and a pound of C4 is standing on this tiny little corrugated bridge right on the pillar that's holding up two pieces of corrugated steel from one end to another.

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:02]** And there are currently four K'foks in view.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:10]** Two of them are on this bridge and a third one is just clamping the top of that barrel and that fourth one is on the nest and about to come down.

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:11]** That's the end of this round.

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:13]** Let's roll into the top of that round.

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:15]** The next round.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:18]** It is going to be... We can make this move a little faster.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:22]** I'm just going to move the K'Fox up to where they would go on their turns.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:23]** Oh, shoot.

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:24]** And I'm going to give you Treme's turn.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:31]** So all the K'Fox kind of scurried forward, but they didn't use their full actions or full moves.

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:33]** They only moved...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:36]** You know, a couple feet here and a couple feet there.

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:37]** That's just weird.

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:39]** That's weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:44]** And one more is going to appear on that nest in the back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:50]** I think if we safely get to the other side, perhaps they won't pursue.

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:52]** Maybe it's a theory of mine.

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:53]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:53 - 00:55:03]** So... I have one... Can I do an engineering check to see if these barrels, if there's any of them that are like, you know...

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:11]** Crucial and of one bulk that could be displaced as to prevent...

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:35]** uh one of the this other kafaka up here uh from pursuing via the uh the barrel jump i'm i'm gonna have to say that the barrels are probably more than one bulk yeah um i will say though if just the whole group anybody has survival do you want to do a survival check or a life science check


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:36 - 00:56:03]** i say survival because i think survival has like the animal i did 20 survival okay what's up with that anybody else i got a 16 on my life signs i've got a four on survival for rolu rolu's looking at the breaching chars he's not thinking about what's going on check out a five we are we are fixated on this c4 yeah makes sense so i think it makes the most sense that thaddeus is the one to know this um

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:06]** Because he rolled the highest on survival and he also has on knowledge.

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:09]** Yeah, they are swarming around their nest.

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:10]** What?

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:13]** So there's more of them coming, is what you're saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:14]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:15]** N plus whatever.

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:16]** Oh, my God.

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:16]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:18]** That's what it is.

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:20]** We better blow this bridge and get the hell out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:24]** So it's Treme and Thaddeus.

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:29]** If you two want to roll together and then decide what you're going to do since you're on the other side of that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:32]** I think if they come any closer, we should blast them out of the sky.

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:34]** Otherwise, maybe we just let them be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:39]** I can see in the distance more of them, if you can believe it, are coming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:42]** You see almost a tsunami of K'foks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:44]** Maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:47]** You see a giant K'fok made up of smaller K'foks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:52]** There's a giant one named Kevin, and he keeps sending more of them at us.

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:53]** We really need to get out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:59]** I want to just delay my turn until these K'foks move.

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:05]** And if they move any closer to Rolu and Chalk, I'm going to blast the one on the bridge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:06]** All right.

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:07]** I'll keep that in mind.

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:10]** Thaddeus, are you going to do something similar?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:15]** Thaddeus told everyone this, so everyone I'm sure is aware that there's a bajillion of them coming.

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:17]** So he's like, we have to make a run for it.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:20]** And does he notice the C4?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:25]** That, I mean, that's up to Vinny how high Chuck held up the C4.

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:30]** But yeah, like I said, Thaddeus is aware that these things are probably just...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:43]** is this c4 is it like rd yes be specific what kind of explosive is this yeah it's like eight sticks of dynamite um let's a breaching charge no uh we'll say it's a pound i mean how big is a pound of c4

**[00:57:44 - 00:58:10]** how does c4 will take out like a building i really i want to google this but i don't want to end up on a list uh yeah i don't let me just pull out let's say an explosive manual real quick let's say it's a shoebox so yeah he has to hold it up because he's a tiny creature so he's like up above his head right right in front of rolu's face so like he's not trying to hide it at all


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:11]** I got this, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:16]** Think Groot running with the bomb at the end of Guardians 2.

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:18]** Oh my goodness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:18]** Above his head.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:19]** Spoiler.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:21]** Well, that's amazing.

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:23]** Thaddeus is 10 feet away and he's a soldier.

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:24]** I'm pretty sure he can recognize it.

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:27]** So he just like shouts at them like, great idea.

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:28]** Blow it up.

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:33]** And then he's just going to buy them some time by double firing against the closest Kvok.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:36]** You could also do, is it Covering Fire or Herring Fire?

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:38]** It's true.

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:40]** What is the two between them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:41]** Covering is AC.

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:44]** Herring gives you a bonus to your attack.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:45]** To attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:55]** So you could do, yeah, covering fire, you roll an attack, and that will lower the AC to anybody who's being attacked by that creature.

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:57]** So just saying.

**[00:58:57 - 00:58:59]** You could use those as an alternative.

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:00]** Do you technically miss when you do that?

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:01]** I forget.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:03]** You have to, yeah, you don't hit.

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:06]** You have to roll to hit AC 15, just a flat 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:13]** And that will give them some bonus against the attack of something, right?


## Speaker_0

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:13]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:24]** Yeah, so if you do Covering Fire against K'vok, the first K'vok there, then it would give a bonus if it attacks... It'll give a bonus to Rolu or Chalk if it goes to attack either one of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:25]** From that creature.

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:27]** You have to specify the creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:29]** And then Herring... I'm so sorry.

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:31]** Herring Fire is...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:32]** It's the opposite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:37]** The next person that attacks that creature would get a bonus.

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:38]** Plus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:42]** From a metagame perspective, it looks like they're pulling up short.

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:45]** We're no longer aggroed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:46]** True.

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:46]** I don't know.

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:52]** Like, yeah, if he's not being aggroed, then maybe I could just try to attack him and do a full action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:54]** I feel like whips would notice that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:58]** Like that they're no longer piercing as aggressively.

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:00]** Okay.

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:00]** Got you.

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:01]** Okay.

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:04]** Well, then what he's going to do is he's going to fire.

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:07]** Take a full action, by the way, Kevin, to fire.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:08]** That's a 22 to hit.

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:11]** And it's just three damage, though.

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:12]** Three piercing damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:14]** You're doing a full action, though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:14]** Correct.

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:16]** So you can fire twice.

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:16]** You're right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:19]** So you're doing minus four with that, though.

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:22]** So you had a 22 to hit, so that's a minus four is 18?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:26]** Yeah, and it's five damage then in that case.

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:29]** So you hit twice.

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:30]** Why would I roll twice if I got it the first time?

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:33]** I thought it was, like, roll twice to, like, you know, for damage.

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:34]** No, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:41]** You can do a standard action to attack, or you can do a full action... A full round attack is two attacks out of minus four each.

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:43]** 18 to hit them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:45]** It works better because...

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:49]** Then you don't... You have better odds of getting one if you don't deal.

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:50]** That makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:54]** Okay, so that's... The first attack was an 18 with three damage.

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:57]** And then you roll to attack again with a minus four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:57 - 01:00:58]** Right.

**[01:00:58 - 01:01:00]** Well, and it was... So I just choose, like, the higher.

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:01]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:03]** So I'm going to go with... No, no, you fire twice.

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:04]** You just fire twice.

**[01:01:04 - 01:01:06]** And so it does hit... The first one does hit for three.

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:07]** Okay, got it.

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:10]** And that Kafak was actually the one...

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:11]** that was already damaged.

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:14]** And so it dies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:25]** So that one is the closest one to you guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:26 - 01:01:26]** You take a shot at it.

**[01:01:26 - 01:01:29]** It crumbles to the ground.

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:33]** And what you notice is the other ones saw that.

**[01:01:34 - 01:01:36]** Rolu, it's your turn.

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:37]** They saw that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:37 - 01:01:39]** Hopefully they would be scared.

**[01:01:39 - 01:01:41]** And we didn't like him anyway.

**[01:01:42 - 01:01:42]** What is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:43 - 01:01:44]** Interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:45]** They've already technically made their turn.

**[01:01:45 - 01:01:48]** They were taking a stand and now you shot one of them.

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:50]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:57]** Can I do an engineering check to make sure that I would know what to do with this charge?

**[01:01:57 - 01:01:58]** That I can just put it down?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:58 - 01:02:00]** I don't know how the charges work.

**[01:02:00 - 01:02:00]** Do you have it?

**[01:02:00 - 01:02:02]** Is it in the description?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:02 - 01:02:23]** um of what to do i think you just have to pass an engineering check to get it to rig the way you want it to and then it'll blow um yeah basically it's the the structures break dc is what we're talking about um so if you so you're rolling like a two hit on that it's an engineering check against the break dc of whatever the structure is okay

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:28]** So that's to place the charge set it to like blow up.

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:39]** Um, and then there's a whole paragraph on how high or low that difference is, uh, that I'll paste into the chat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:39]** Okay.

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:41]** But this is super cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:41 - 01:02:45]** Um, just going to say there's a mark one demolition below on the bridge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:48]** Mark one demolition, uh,

**[01:02:48 - 01:03:17]** have i feel like there's a thing in the game mastering section about uh material like you know hit points um and hardness and things like that yeah i'm sure there is it's materials yeah i think it's 408 so yeah 409 breaking objects this rule set is from tech revolution okay page 68 the check so if you let check by 10 or more the explosion doesn't harm the structure

**[01:03:17 - 01:03:27]** If you fail to check by nine or less, the explosion deals 3d6 bludgeoning damage plus an additional d6 for every two item levels of the primary explosive charge to the structure.

**[01:03:28 - 01:03:28]** Okay.

**[01:03:28 - 01:03:31]** So basically you would just need to figure out what hit points this thing has.

**[01:03:31 - 01:03:35]** Then I make my check and see how much I fail or succeed by.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:35 - 01:03:35]** All right.

**[01:03:35 - 01:03:37]** So you're targeting hit points of this thing?

**[01:03:37 - 01:03:38]** Is that what's happening?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:39 - 01:03:45]** No, it's hardness and hit points because it says depending on how much you fail by.

**[01:03:45 - 01:03:47]** I follow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:47 - 01:03:49]** So what are you targeting right now?

**[01:03:49 - 01:03:51]** Roll what you're targeting and give me a number.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:52]** What's the DC?

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:54]** I think you gave me that DC.

**[01:03:54 - 01:03:54]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:54 - 01:03:57]** I have it in my mind, so go ahead and tell me the number.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:58 - 01:03:59]** Roll that engineering goodness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:59 - 01:04:07]** I think Rollo's going to say, just kind of look over his shoulder, but not really, and say, is everyone standing safely behind me at a safe distance?

**[01:04:08 - 01:04:08]** I hope so.

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:18]** And Rollo's going to bend down and put it at the part of the panel that's over, not the panel he's on, the one in front of him that's over the liquid.

**[01:04:19 - 01:04:20]** Beep, beep, beep, beep.

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:22]** That is a 23.

**[01:04:23 - 01:04:24]** Yeah!

**[01:04:24 - 01:04:45]** to set it there okay uh and then what do you do and then i i don't know how this charts is there a remote i'm gonna assume that that there's some sort of time right i think you delay the you set a fuse basically yeah so that's kind of my question so you're like you just set it and stand there

**[01:04:46 - 01:04:50]** No, I'm going to... Noble sacrifice roll.

**[01:04:51 - 01:04:51]** Very good.

**[01:04:51 - 01:04:52]** Good job.

**[01:04:52 - 01:04:54]** And then I jump on the breach.

**[01:04:54 - 01:04:56]** And I say, Jack, you're going with me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:56 - 01:04:58]** And I clutch Jack to my chest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:58 - 01:05:00]** And I jump.

**[01:05:00 - 01:05:00]** That's it.

**[01:05:00 - 01:05:01]** And that's the whole thing.

**[01:05:02 - 01:05:11]** No, I'm going to run back past... I'm going to run back to the shore.

**[01:05:13 - 01:05:14]** And stand with everybody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:15 - 01:05:18]** The five of you have made it to the other shore.

**[01:05:18 - 01:05:23]** Chuck was grabbed on and clenched along as you set this charge and started running.

**[01:05:23 - 01:05:32]** And actually what I'm going to do is I'm going to move you guys down a little bit further because as you start running off this bridge, I'm sure the rest of them follow.

**[01:05:32 - 01:05:54]** and so you guys are going to get far enough away as the rest of the K'foks are also charging at you now that you killed one of theirs and they were like giving you the out and you didn't take it and so these dozens of K'foks start coming out of this nest from the back I'm going to just add a few more for your flavor here way to go whips

**[01:05:55 - 01:05:57]** And they start piling onto this bridge.

**[01:05:57 - 01:06:02]** It's almost like it's just slightly out of like, what was that movie?

**[01:06:04 - 01:06:05]** Z-Day or whatever with Brad Pitt.

**[01:06:06 - 01:06:07]** World War Z. Oh, yeah.

**[01:06:07 - 01:06:08]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:06:08 - 01:06:09]** Climbing atop each other.

**[01:06:09 - 01:06:11]** Plying over each other, trying to get over towards you.

**[01:06:12 - 01:06:15]** And as they like cross the part where that charge is.

**[01:06:15 - 01:06:16]** Beep, beep.

**[01:06:17 - 01:06:19]** It explodes.

**[01:06:19 - 01:06:21]** Freaking amazing.

**[01:06:22 - 01:06:25]** And just shards of K'vok go flying everywhere.

**[01:06:25 - 01:06:27]** The bridge is destroyed.

**[01:06:27 - 01:06:31]** You guys all dive to the sand, and that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:33 - 01:06:37]** That was awesome.

**[01:06:39 - 01:06:40]** I knew that was going to come in handy.

**[01:06:40 - 01:06:42]** That merchant's going to be happy with all the Kefauk meat now.

**[01:06:43 - 01:06:44]** Just chilling out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:44 - 01:06:48]** We're going to make bank on the Kefauk meat market.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:48 - 01:06:51]** It's going to rain Kefauk kebab.

**[01:06:51 - 01:06:52]** Kefauk kebab is for everybody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:52 - 01:06:54]** Did we just tank the Kefauk market?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:55 - 01:06:57]** I think we did.

**[01:06:57 - 01:07:01]** We should have just put that charge in the saturated garage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:07:01 - 01:07:03]** That's amazing.

**[01:07:03 - 01:07:06]** Thanks for listening, you scallywags.

**[01:07:07 - 01:07:12]** Until next week, drift begones on Distant Stars.
