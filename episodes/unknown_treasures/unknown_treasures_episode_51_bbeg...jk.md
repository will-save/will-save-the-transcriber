**[00:00:01 - 00:00:13]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:14]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:15]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:16]** Get out.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:19]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:22]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:23 - 00:00:30]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales of the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:33]** unknown treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:00:56 - 00:00:59]** Welcome back to We'll Save in the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:01:08 - 00:01:15]** So we have Kelly, John, Will, Vinny, and an incredibly special guest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:15 - 00:01:16]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:16 - 00:01:21]** The one, the only, writer of Junker's Delight, Jason Keeley.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:23 - 00:01:23]** Welcome.

**[00:01:23 - 00:01:24]** Hello there.

**[00:01:24 - 00:01:26]** I didn't see you come in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:28]** And come into my office.

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:29]** Yeah, we've been here.

**[00:01:29 - 00:01:30]** Is this the right room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:32]** Yes, please, please, have a seat.

**[00:01:32 - 00:01:34]** Sit down at my...

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:36]** Come here to my junkyard mansion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:38]** Yes.

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:40]** Thank you again so much for doing this.

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:41]** We really do appreciate it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:41]** You're welcome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:44]** And I'm just really excited to have you on personally.

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:47]** So you are currently a product developer for Renegade.

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:48]** Is that correct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:48]** That's right.

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:51]** Renegade Game Studios has been working on their Essence 20 system.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:55]** Most of them, I should say, because there's several licenses.

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:57]** That includes Power Rangers, G.I.

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:58]** Joe, Transformers.

**[00:01:58 - 00:02:01]** So I get to do all the sort of fun 80s cartoon stuff.

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:02]** That's neat.


## Speaker_0

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:02]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:03]** Cool.

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:06]** Is there anything else you want to tell us about yourself before we move on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:07]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:18]** I mean, you know, I was at Paizo for a long time, working my way up from editor to over, more sideways, to developer to work on the Starfinder portable look.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:20]** And I sort of had been on Starfinder for like five years.

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:22]** And hopefully produced.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:23]** I don't know.

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:24]** I think we made a lot of good stuff.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:25]** I got to say.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:27]** And they're still continuing to make good stuff.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:29]** No slight on what's happening now.

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:30]** Of course, I'm excited.

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:34]** I know some stuff, too, that has not been announced that we already have talked about before I left.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:37]** So and I think people are going to be excited about some other things.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:47]** I think there's the most recent thing that I know that has been talked about that I want to want to go check out at some point is a ports of call.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:51]** It's one of the latest Starfinder books.

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:52]** It should be out, I think, in March or April.

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:55]** And...

**[00:02:56 - 00:03:04]** In that, I wrote something that I didn't, that was very silly and I didn't think people would want, other people in the department would want, but I was like, let's do it.

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:12]** And it's Galarian World, the Galarian theme park in the Starfinder universe.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:25]** I just wanted to have like, you know, real, just sort of like Renaissance fair meets Disney World with everything just slightly, maybe a little wrong or a little over exaggerated from what you know from the Pathfinder universe so that you can really play it.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:54]** really goofy stuff can you tell us what planet that takes place on i'm very curious um oh god there's a it's stone planet it's its own planet okay out in the uh out in the near space i think and i forgot the name of the original planet uh but now it's just called galarian world and you get there you book a trip and it's a fall all-inclusive thing where you get to if you want to you can go on adventures out in the wilderness but then there's like you know there's like a mwangi land and shackles land and uh osirian land

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:56]** and Chelliacsland and stuff like that.

**[00:03:56 - 00:04:04]** And there's like a, you know, you get to Chelliacsland and you meet Queen Abigail Throon, who is obviously an actress playing Queen Abigail Throon, who just insults you the whole time.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:05]** And everyone's like, yeah, it's great.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:08]** The costume devil's like, ah, I'm a devil.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:09]** I'm going to make you sign a contract.

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:15]** It's very, very just sort of playing into the silliest things I could think of.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:16]** So look for that.

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:19]** I'm very excited to see how that came out.

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:22]** There's some art that I did see that's just basically like this big, deep part where they

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:27]** the aliens of Starfinder out there just getting corn dogs and adventurers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:28]** I love that.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:30]** We had the whole thing with K'vok dogs here in Junkers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:32]** Oh yeah, oh boy.

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:35]** Oh, that's like eating roach.

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:38]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:41]** Roach kebabs.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:42]** That's amazing.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:45]** And I have to say one thing, too.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:52]** Obviously, Jason, you are the author of a very important book of the threefold conspiracy.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:53]** So thank you for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:56]** You're welcome.

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:57]** You're welcome.

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:58]** That was fantastic.

**[00:04:58 - 00:05:04]** It was a blast to write, and the twist at the end was also just, I don't know.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:05]** I thought that was really funny.

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:06]** Spoiler alert.

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:07]** I'm not going to say this.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:08]** Hey, there's a twist at the end.

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:09]** That's all.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:10]** That's all you need to know.

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:10]** It's fine.

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:10]** It's fine.

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:11]** It's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:12]** It could be anything.

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:13]** Like M. Night Shyamalan?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:15]** You were expecting one way and then went another.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:15]** Yeah.

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:16]** Yeah.

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:19]** Ports of Call and Glory World sound amazing.

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:20]** Thank you for sharing that with us.

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:21]** That's a cool idea.

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:22]** It's really cool.

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:23]** I love it.

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:25]** I love weird thing books.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:29]** I hate to sound like weird about this, but like, I didn't, I didn't invite you here to interview you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:31]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:31]** Well, I gotta go.

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:32]** Right.

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:34]** No, I actually, I invited you to play.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:35]** Oh, let's do it.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:36]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:47]** And so I do want to say like, if you want to hear a really good interview with Jason about Jason, uh, STF, um, network has Southern Tomfoolery unlimited number 13.

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:49]** That is your episode.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:49]** Um,

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:53]** Um, they're now called strange table fellows, but we'll drop a link for that.

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:54]** I highly recommend you guys listen to that.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:58]** Uh, I also, I've been following you kind of on digital divination as well.

**[00:05:58 - 00:06:03]** And digital divination number 68, you talk specifically about this, this book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:05]** Oh, that's true.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:06]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:07]** Yeah.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:14]** Couple of the couple of things I pulled from that was the fact that you based Junkers Delight was kind of like loosely based on Rapper's Delight.

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:16]** Just the title, essentially.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:18]** I don't know where my brain was at the time.

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:20]** And I was like, this is a weird name.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:21]** And I couldn't get it.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:23]** Sometimes things get stuck in my head.

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:23]** I just got to run down.

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:25]** I was like, I want to call it Junkers Delight.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:26]** And everyone's like, yeah, sure, whatever.

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:27]** And I'm like, OK.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:28]** Sure, let's do it.

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:31]** This passed a lot of people saying yes, so that sounds good.

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:32]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:38]** I mean, if Eric Mona says I can write Galarian World or write a book called Junker's Delight,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:38]** Do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:40]** I'm going to do it.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:42]** You can't stop me now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:48]** Another fun note about that was you mentioned that you actually were the one that wrote part of Akiton's story.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:52]** You wrote Kafak Depot into the Akiton part of Pact World.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:59]** And that's kind of where, when the idea of doing a standalone came about, you were like, well, I wrote about this fun little town.

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:01]** We could just explore that so much more.

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:04]** And it's alternative what it is, and we love it so much.


## Speaker_0

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:05]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:35]** think that's that's all the notes i have on that and i think before we get into playing i do want to let us go around and do just a quick quick fire each of us will ask you one question and then if you want you can ask each of us one question in return just to be fair um and i think i will start uh you once tweeted that you have five years of improv experience can you expand on that sure i was i did a lot of improv in college i um i mean at least five years i


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:38]** I was kind of a theater nerd, let's say.

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:43]** I did some high school theater and then I was like, I'm going to go to this.

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:46]** My major at the time was biochemistry, but I was a theater nerd.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:51]** And so I went to audition for this one play.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:54]** It's like my sophomore year after I'd finally kind of settled in.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:58]** And it was the play Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead.

**[00:07:58 - 00:07:58]** Great play.

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:00]** Great movie.

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:01]** Check that out.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:02]** I didn't get it apart.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:06]** But at the time the person who was directing it, she said, we know we're doing this improv.

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:06]** You should come.

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:08]** And I was like, oh, I love Whose Line Is It Anyway.

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:09]** I watched that.

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:12]** That was like my go to show during my first year of college.

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:14]** The old British one.

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:16]** She mentioned watching that.

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:17]** Loved that.

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:18]** And I was like, yeah.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:20]** And I started doing improv and I started doing too much improv.

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:37]** to the point where I ended up running the section of the theater group for a little bit as well, and then starting my own one after college where we kind of did some improv in the cafe of a Borders bookstore that I was also working in.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:39]** Borders, yeah.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:40]** Yeah, remember Borders, everyone?

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:44]** I've worked in a lot of places that have closed down completely.

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:46]** I worked at Circuit City headquarters once.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:49]** Some of our listeners might have no idea what you're talking about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:51]** Hold on a second.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:56]** Books are these things that have old words on it.

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:57]** Paper with words on them.

**[00:08:58 - 00:08:59]** Yeah.

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:00]** So we did that.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:09]** And then I took a little bit of that to New York City after college too and did one or two minor shows that not a lot of people showed up to.

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:10]** So improv.

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:11]** Great.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:14]** I'm kind of in your same boat with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:21]** I did a little bit of acting in high school, and then in college, I was an engineering student, but I was taking improv classes on the side just for fun.

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:23]** But nothing came out of that.

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:25]** Did a little background acting too in LA while I was there.

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:26]** Oh, nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:27]** Great.

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:28]** Kelly, what's your question?

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:29]** He's being humble.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:30]** He did some more than that.

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:36]** What is your favorite gaming system, TTRPG-wise?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:36 - 00:10:02]** yeah right now um i mean i i'd like i like to have a lot of gaming systems like in my in the back of my head you know as i you know i love starfinder i really love what they're doing with what they do with pathfinder second edition but sort of the one i'm a little stuck on right now is the blades in the dark stuff oh yeah all right we might try to prep that yeah it's good it's good yeah there's been a lot of blades discussion on not on the air but in the podcast for sure

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:02]** Fair enough.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:09]** I ran a little bit of it, and I played a little bit more of it.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:15]** The core one, I started playing this common villainy, the sci-fi Blades of the Dark hack.

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:24]** And I wrote, at the beginning of the pandemic, I wrote a Wild West, a weird West hack for it that I just ran.

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:26]** I didn't really plan on doing anything with it.

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:32]** And then I am in the process of reading Court of Blades.

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:40]** which is a gunpowder diplomacy, political intrigue and romance hack for Blades in the Dark that I'm probably going to end up running.

**[00:10:40 - 00:11:06]** cool in the next month or two nice so very excited about that yeah that's cool yeah blades is awesome we saw it live once so good such a good system yeah i i also happen to be listening to and not to plug not to talk about a different podcast also listening through the adventure zones uh they're running blades in the dark but really they're they're in they're doing a theme park thing another thing that's what i want to listen to it because i like it but

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:18]** They're doing a weird Westworld theme park situation, but they're using core Blades in the Dark, even though all their stuff is more sci-fi than it is gritty, dark fantasy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:18]** Nice.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:19]** That's cool.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:20]** Who's next?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:20]** Will?

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:21]** Come back to me.

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:23]** I'm still thinking about what I want to ask.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:24]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:26]** Yeah, I'll jump in with one.

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:39]** What was either the game that you were playing or the moment that you thought to yourself, wow, TTRPGs or games like this, board games, this is awesome.

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:41]** The one that kicked it off for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:49]** Okay, so I didn't actually play until after college, with a minor exception of maybe once playing it.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:51]** high school for like on a bus trip or something.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:58]** But like I was kind of more video gamer at the time and I knew the existence of Dungeons and Dragons and things like that.

**[00:11:58 - 00:12:02]** I was like, look, after doing some improv, I was looking at it going,

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:05]** if I start playing TTRPGs, I'm not gonna be able to stop.

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:07]** I just know it, I just know it.

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:19]** And I was right, because I didn't do it until after college when I got a bunch of, an old college friend of mine invited me to a game with her friends that, some of whom were working at the Renaissance Fair at the time, and some of them were professional actors.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:22]** and it was a real blast.

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:38]** We played a vampire, it wasn't quite Vampire of the Masquerade, but it was a vampire-like game where they were like, well, I didn't make a character, we're gonna, it's cool, the first time, you know, if you wanna be in this, you can play, this character has, you know, a little younger brother who hasn't been turned into a vampire yet.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:41]** And I was like, yeah, I'll just jump in and I'll pick it up, whatever.

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:43]** It's like improv, I'll be fine.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:45]** And then they were like, oh, then you get really wounded.

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:48]** And then your older brother comes over and he's like, drink the vampire blood.

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:49]** And they're like, do you drink the vampire blood?

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:51]** I'm like, no, I don't drink the vampire blood.

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:53]** I'll leave and my character, this little guy will die and I'll just walk away.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:56]** And I'll be like, no, of course I drink the vampire blood.

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:57]** I'll turn me into a vampire.

**[00:12:57 - 00:12:58]** That's what I'm here to do.

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:02]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:03]** Vinny or Will?

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:03]** Vinny or Will?

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:07]** You've got to play one video game and only one video game for the rest of your life.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:07]** What is it and why?

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:08]** Good question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:11]** No, only one video game.

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:20]** Spider-Man, the Marvel Spider-Man.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:20]** Ooh.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:21]** It's very good.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:23]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:24]** Is that part two of the new one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:25]** The Miles Morales?

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:26]** The one is out.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:30]** I did play Miles Morales over the winter break, but I sort of count that all as new games.

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:35]** That's basically the game.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:37]** That or one of the Arkham Batmans.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:38]** I love that fighting system.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:40]** Oh, it's such a good series.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:41]** Yeah, and that's a good series.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:50]** I feel like they took that whole counter combat system that Assassin's Creed was trying to refine and just knocked it out of the park.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:50]** Yeah.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:52]** But we're not a video game podcast.

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:54]** We're a TTRG podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:56]** Not yet, man.

**[00:13:56 - 00:14:00]** I wanted to ask, what was your favorite part of working on this story?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:30]** good question good question i uh my favorite part is of course the um the space goblin at kestie not quite not quite romeo and juliet but sort of star-crossed friends from the two warring tribes of the jungle the junk fields uh american cats i had a little difficulty remembering their names but um the fact that uh uh that it was writing their diet when they when you finally meet them and writing their dialogue was just a lot of a lot i also like riddle a lot


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:51]** lot too yeah it was fun yeah yeah so they're not lovers we had a we had a bit of a romance between uh our kasathan and anakesti we got a little little cute yeah yeah yeah cool well i i was gonna let you do rounds and ask us each a question if you were prepared for that we can otherwise we can save it for next episode


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:51 - 00:15:20]** uh what do we see for the next episode and then maybe just one blanket question to the all of to the to the five oh interesting okay okay just sort of situation can i can i have a bonus question yes okay kevin i say yes awesome so as an editor of the core rulebook i'm assuming you're intimately involved with most of these rules so like do you have a favorite rules lawyer moment at any point that you want to share

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:22]** And if not, we can just cut this whole thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:23]** I'm not sure.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:25]** Don't rules lawyer too much.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:27]** I try to play by the rules as much as possible.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:37]** But over the past, I would say, five or six years, I've gotten a little less stringent about the rules and a little more freeform about sorts of things.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:41]** And now for the life of me, I cannot remember a single Starfinder rule.

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:46]** Um, so I don't know if I can answer that question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:47]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:55]** Uh, so you're saying it's a handwritten like manuscript.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:55 - 00:16:01]** Um, so I mean, it's, it's sort of right in theme.

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:04]** Uh, it's become sort of the pirate's code where they're more like guidelines.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:05]** Yes, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:06]** I don't know.

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:08]** I think pirate codes are pretty set in stone, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:12]** Even though, could I ask something off of Vinny's question then?

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:14]** Your specific opinion on this one rule.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:18]** We have a homebrew rule where we... Well, I'll just ask.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:23]** Should you be able to cast magic missile non-lethally?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:24]** Yeah.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:25]** Oh, that's interesting.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:26]** I don't see why not.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:32]** I mean, look, I know, I know, I know for a fact that like, in both both sides, yes.

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:38]** I know that Pathfinder First Edition has a thing where like you do metamagic spell and it becomes a non-lethal spell.

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:40]** I think there's like a metamagic feat for that.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:44]** I don't think that ever, we ever really wrote metamagic feats into Starfinder.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:50]** So I think that we could just sort of hand wave it and be like, yeah, I mean, I, you know, often boom, boom, boom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:55]** The argument came up because the rule specifically says for non-lethal, it says weapons.

**[00:16:55 - 00:17:00]** It calls out using a lethal weapon as non-lethal.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:03]** It doesn't apply to spells is the argument because it says weapon.

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:05]** Semantics being semantics.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:07]** You don't have to take any penalties.

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:10]** You don't make an attack with a magic missile.

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:18]** I feel like, I don't know if this is 100% true, but there's somewhere in there that says when you reduce a creature to zero hit points...

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:23]** you just sort of just, like, maybe the GM decides whether or not they're dead or unconscious.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:27]** So, I mean, you can work with your GM to be like, well, I finished him off with that magic missile.

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:28]** That was not lethal.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:30]** So you can interrogate them.

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:33]** It's just sort of helpful to be like, you don't have to necessarily keep track of whether or not they're dying.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:35]** You know, like, oh, you did.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:36]** Well, they've gone to negative 10.

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:38]** Like, you know, it's not, you know, that kind of stuff.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:40]** When they hit zero, they're out of the fight for sure.

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:41]** Whether or not they're dead or alive.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:43]** It's kind of story-wise.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:45]** Doesn't, you know, up to the group.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:48]** Your position is still, as you said, why not?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:49]** Stop telling me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:50]** We're going to play the game.

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:52]** Let's play Starfinder.

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:53]** Let it be known.

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:55]** Mr. Keeley said so.

**[00:17:55 - 00:17:56]** All right, here we go.

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:56]** Here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:57 - 00:18:07]** All right, so just outside the Stellar Flare, unbeknownst to the Caduceus crew, so Caduceus, just for Jason, is the name of the free captain ship that these four came from.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:08]** A healing ship, of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:19]** So unbeknownst to the Caduceus crew, the Shabbat leader of the true warriors is holding a Hilki, a wounded Hilki, by the neck and raised up to his eye level.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:23]** Jotrulu, please, please don't kill me.

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:27]** What does Jotrulu do next, Jason?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:32]** Give me one good reason that I shouldn't tell you.

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:32]** You failed.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:34]** I'll tell you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:35]** I'll tell you.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:36]** Please don't.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:40]** And then that's when Tez, standing next to Trulu, says, tell us everything that happened in there.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:42]** And he starts to tell you.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:45]** Do you let him down first or are you still holding him high in the air?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:48]** No, I'm holding him up.

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:51]** Maybe not by the neck so much, so he can speak.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:55]** Alright, we breached just like you told us.

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:59]** The new guy held up the shield and Switchstick, he slid in and took out the turret.

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:02]** Then Lieutenant Rayburn took the point.

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:06]** She told me and Gavin to go left and the new guy to go right.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:10]** That's when Switchstick, she sent him forward to disarm something in the middle.

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:15]** Right after he did that, this wall of steam trapped Rayburn and Switchstick.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:17]** Steam?

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:18]** It must be magic.

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:25]** And Testronin turns to Dotru and tells him, I believe at least one of them is casters.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:26]** I'm sure of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:28]** This is just perfect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:29]** And the guy continues.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:33]** Rayburn got out, but it killed Switchstick.

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:38]** Me and the crew, me and the new guy, we got stuck behind the steam wall.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:41]** We couldn't see much, but we kept shooting, I swear.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:44]** We got some hits in, but the new guy didn't last long.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:48]** That's when I heard the shots from the left where Rayburn and Gavin went.

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:53]** I heard Rayburn cry out to fall back, but she never came back out.

**[00:19:54 - 00:20:03]** So all four of them are still standing, and he's held up by the neck, he nods, and then looks down in disgrace.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:06]** All right, throw him to the ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:30]** uh tez patch him up uh you get a drink of water you're going back in there with me all right i like it uh let me move you guys over to the map and we're gonna move back inside the stellar flare oh for you guys there's an eerie silence oh what are you doing this is the first time jason that you're seeing the map so make sure you've got good visual


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:31]** Oh, there it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:32]** All right.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:34]** So what are you guys doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:40]** Rolu, I think I could use that stamina healing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:42]** Oh, absolutely.

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:48]** And Rolu is in the cafeteria, steps outside next to Thaddeus.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:51]** Thaddeus lifts an eyebrow as he walks by.

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:53]** Rulu just does not look like that is.

**[00:20:55 - 00:21:06]** And I think as Rulu is about to cross the central arterial hallway, Rulu gets probably maybe 10 feet across.

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:14]** And I don't think on the map, Kev, that I can see Drulu yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:15]** No, you should not be able to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:16]** Okay.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:34]** So to Rolo, he's walking across and he stops in front of Terme and uses his spell Blessings of Youth to give you stamina points back.

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:37]** And you should be getting eight stamina points.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:38]** Dang.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:39]** Thanks, man.

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:40]** Yes.

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:41]** Yes.

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:41]** People check that.

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:42]** I'll message you if it's wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:43]** Shock.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:43]** Man.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:44]** Shock.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:46]** That really did the trick, actually.

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:47]** Thanks, Rolo.

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:47]** You know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:49]** What's up, Thaddeus?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:51]** It's a shame you're kind of a traitor.

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:52]** Yeah.

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:54]** Everyone knows it.

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:57]** But we can discuss it later.

**[00:21:57 - 00:22:00]** I just hope we can get out of this now.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:02]** It's eerily quiet in here.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:03]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:05]** Shocked you have that puck.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:08]** Still, you didn't give it to Rolu, did you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:11]** Chuck looks down at the very obvious bulge in his pants.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:13]** I just don't want to assume shock.

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:14]** I mean, I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:15]** I don't know what that is.

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:17]** I mean, I'm not particularly happy to see you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:20]** Classic.

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:22]** All right.

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:24]** It's likely that there might be more of them.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:26]** We should probably scout ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:29]** Hey, that true warrior ran away.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:31]** I thought we were done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:31 - 00:23:01]** i believe we're done we should maybe uh fix that turret i bet i think that's a wise idea all right all right i will go forward and i'm gonna see if there's anyone else lurking he starts to make his way towards the entrance i'll fix the turret i'll help uh check check hops on rolu's shoulder guys make sure uh you're not in the hallway when this thing goes on remember uh yeah rolu shack watch out maybe steer clear of that corner can i have one of those carts


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:02]** I don't know.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:04]** Maybe I could clone it.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:06]** Could I do something like that?

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:07]** Can we clone cards?

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:09]** Yeah, can I get my flipper out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:11]** Do you have a flipper or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:13]** A little hacking device, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:14]** Do you have a flipper?

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:16]** Does Jason know what a flipper is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:17]** Did I say?

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:41]** It's like a device for hacking it's like a hackers Tamagotchi So you're asking if you could use that in-game Is that possible mechanically to duplicate these cards I guess so you guys are trying to Repair the turret

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:42]** Yes.

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:45]** I'm going to say it's an engineering check, but it's going to be very high.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:50]** This is the second time you guys have repaired it after disabling it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:52]** Rolly, what's your engineering?

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:57]** I'm only sort of skilled at it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:23:57 - 00:24:01]** My engineering bonus is...

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:02]** Plus nine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:06]** Oh, yeah, you should probably take lead on this, maybe.

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:07]** I'll try to help.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:10]** Yeah, I've done this twice so far.

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:12]** That's going to be a 29 GM.

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:13]** I aid.

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:15]** So a 31.

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:17]** And Chuck aids.

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:17]** 33.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:19]** You guys have to be kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:24]** Suck it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:27]** I hate you.

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:29]** I hate you all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:31]** It's always the way.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:33]** Always how it happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:35]** I have to move it back to the token layer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:24:38 - 00:25:04]** a remote switch on it perhaps i think we just barely got it working this is the third time that we've revived this here's a fun thought though is really we need to run away it's got 10 seconds before it activates yeah roll the shot you need to get out of dodge before it activates so you guys gotta get out of here all right 10 all right nine yeah i run back up behind in the hallway seven


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:11]** Because only two of them, and they have the green dots marking them, have the badges that let the turret recognize them as friends.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:13]** So, yes.

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:17]** Okay, so that turret is active, and your time is up.

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:18]** I'm going to say we're going to go back outside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:21]** I think we should get back down the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:22]** What do you think, Zarius?

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:24]** I don't know if there's anyone else out there.

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:28]** Does your, like, mind link work on...

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:30]** people that you don't know are around or not?

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:31]** Can you just target an area?

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:32]** I don't know.

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:33]** I haven't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:35]** Let me just double check.

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:37]** If so, you should threaten whoever's out there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:43]** Communicate with any creatures within 30 feet with which you share language.

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:47]** Functions like assurance limited to help the racial trait.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:50]** I would assume if they're within 30 feet.

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:51]** You could just megaphone it.

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:53]** It'd be like, is anyone out there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:53 - 00:26:08]** is there like a material limitation though like that's what i'm thinking if there's uh all this metal between you and them yeah also 30 feet only gets me to like the this sort of first hallway yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:14]** All right, so the camera's going to flash back to outside, and Tez Tronin says to Dotrulu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:16]** Didn't we talk to him on the intercoms, though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:17]** A while ago, way back when.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:18]** Did we try him on that?

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:20]** The intercom that you try to use is back in the lab.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:22]** You can give that a try, too, if you want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:23]** What do you think that is?

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:26]** I think intercom's a good thing to do.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:29]** But, yeah, take up position in the main artery again.

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:31]** Get your guns and spells ready, all right?

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:32]** Sure thing.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:34]** Shaq, you want to see who's left?

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:36]** You were on the intercom before.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:37]** You want to call out?

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:44]** If it's all clear, we can leave, but... If they just gave up and walked away, you can go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:47]** Yeah, let me scramble back up to the intercom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:51]** So Shaq runs... Just make sure you avoid this hallway.

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:52]** You stay here, Rolu.

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:53]** That thing's on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:56]** So we're going to cut back to outside while you guys are doing that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:59]** Maybe give the badge to Rolu if you're going to...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:04]** Testronin is standing next to Dotrulu, and she looks up at him because he is 12 feet tall.

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:07]** What do you want us to do now, boss?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:13]** This and the things on the whole ship is mine.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:26]** I don't want any of these space pilots coming down here to my city on my planet trying to take my stuff away from me.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:27]** We're going in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:28]** Let's do it.

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:28]** Roll out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:33]** Hey, do you guys want to hear the sequel?

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:34]** There was another one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:38]** They were in New York, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:40]** Yeah.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:42]** So the intercom crackles alive.

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:45]** Do you want to talk back to them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:48]** Oh, can I talk to them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:54]** Yeah, because just a little history is that Kesh had fixed the intercom system.

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:59]** And Tez took over that to talk to them the first time.

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:05]** But Chalk relayed the entire story of Home Alone to them while they were setting traps inside.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:06]** So he's back on the intercom.

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:10]** And I guess so Trulu is standing right next to the intercom system so he could hear it.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:14]** So Tez points out the button to make it work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:15]** Oh.

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:17]** Well, let's see what we can do here.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:21]** Attention, lackeys of Captain Goldhorn.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:25]** Look, just because we live in the desert here doesn't mean we have our heads in the sand.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:26]** We know who you are.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:31]** But what you are, you found something there in this here ship.

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:35]** By car, pillar of the sky, it is mine.

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:36]** But I'm feeling like in a good mood today.

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:43]** So I'm going to give you to the count of 10 to leave and leave everything else behind and we won't kill you.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:44]** All right?

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:46]** To be honest, I hope you don't.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:48]** We're kind of itching for a fight.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:51]** My Dashko hasn't tasted flesh in a couple weeks.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:58]** And honestly, I think you're pretty worn out and tired by this point.

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:01]** Anyway, you have to the count of ten.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:03]** Ten.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:06]** Hey guys, he says to leave everything.

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:06]** Nine.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:08]** We have ten seconds left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:10]** Tell him to screw off.

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:11]** Eight.

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:13]** No, it's not happening, man.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:15]** Seven.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:16]** All right, everyone, take your positions.

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:17]** They're going to come in.

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:20]** We said to come in, you filthy animal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:21]** Five, four, three, two, one.

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:22]** All right, let's go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:31]** And as we're about to do that, the true warrior that came out actually warns them, like, we disabled that turret, but that thing tore them to pieces.

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:34]** And Tez goes, well, you're going in first.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:34]** Check it.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:41]** And she puts the gun to his face and says, you're going in or you're dying here.

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:46]** And so this first true warrior...

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:47]** Don't try and true lawyer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:48]** Make a great dental plan.

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:50]** Yeah, totally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:54]** So this first true lawyer, he kind of turns in that corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:57]** No regular health system.

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:58]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:14]** He's going to go into that first door and he knows nothing happens after that first door and he looks back at them just scared and Tez lifts her gun a little higher and he looks back and starts marching up and he's going to just like very nervously step through that scanner.

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:18]** And at first it doesn't go off and then it does.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:44]** that poor turret that turret just like lifts up and just drills into him rips him to shreds and then goes red it is no longer no longer working it's not disabled is what i'm gonna say okay i'm gonna like i'm gonna mark it red so it's overheated it's my turn on later it's come on later it's junked

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:46]** And this is, I mean, I got to mark this guy dead.

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:46]** Hold on one second.

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:48]** Dead.

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:49]** He's dead.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:51]** And I'm going to just drop him to the map layer.

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:52]** Freeze up your payments.

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:53]** Get him out of the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:58]** Send his widow a bouquet of flowers or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:58 - 00:30:59]** That's so nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:01]** Come on, boss.

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:01]** Okay.

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:03]** And so just for everybody's knowledge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:06]** Reimbursement benefit, but nobody's graduated yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:08]** We're going to put his kid through college.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:08]** Don't worry about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:34]** i'm gonna roll a d6 okay man for that turret that's all i'm gonna say and that's for everyone including you and me jason all right okay what i need now from everyone i need initiatives i need each of you to roll initiative including you uh jason and i know you're a bonus if you don't

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:36]** Six, my good man.

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:38]** Six for Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:40]** Ten for Chak.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:41]** Ten for Chak.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:43]** Ten for Rolu.

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:45]** What are your guys' bonuses?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:47]** Plus three for Rolu.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:47]** Plus four.

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:48]** Plus two.

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:49]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:49]** It doesn't really matter.

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:50]** I got 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:51]** So Rolu goes first.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:53]** 13 for Terme.

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:56]** And what was yours, Jason?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:57 - 00:31:57]** Oh, Lord.

**[00:31:58 - 00:31:59]** I actually just won.

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:00]** Oh, and here we go.

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:00]** I'm running.


## Speaker_0

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:01]** I'm...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:07]** Starting off strong with a natural one on that roll and a six total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:07]** Okay.

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:08]** All right.

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:10]** Give me one second.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:13]** I do this on Excel, so I have to readjust this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:16]** This is what happens in my Vaunt games, too.

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:17]** I just roll off.

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:20]** Data.

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:25]** So I'm being counted as GM dice for me tonight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:27]** Well, let's hope it's only for the first roll and then for the rest of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:32]** Yeah, sometimes then it gets better and then we'll start rolling super high.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:33]** Yeah, of course.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:38]** Well, you're not the lowest on the initiative order.

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:38]** Okay, sure.

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:42]** But the one that was the lowest is the guy that was sent in to die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:43]** So, perfect.

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:45]** Oh, he requested the initiative order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:46]** I know.

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:47]** He was still on there.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:48]** Okay.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:49]** Cool.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:50]** Well, it is now...

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:56]** So Dotrulu, you're standing outside, and Tez Tronin, she just sent that guy in.

**[00:32:56 - 00:33:00]** They know that the turret's off, and Yosuke's gonna go in first.

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:11]** So I'm gonna mark this Yosuke as number one, and he's gonna march in, gets to start there, and he's gonna step- I see someone coming.

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:14]** Up and into the frame, and let me roll a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:15]** I see them too.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:17]** That's good, because I can't see anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:18]** We're rolling perception checks?

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:20]** I rolled a perception check.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:20]** Ooh.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:21]** Gotcha.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:48]** i see okay uh not enough i was gonna see if he could see if he he recognized anything on that turret to tell him whether or not it's it's good but he's standing in that that uh um scanner area and it's not going off so that's the end of his turn it is now the next uh true warriors turn this guy looks kind of young maybe possibly the brother of the guy that just died hard to say


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:49]** Oh, sorry for your loss.

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:52]** Get in there and kill those people.

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:54]** I'll take those flowers to mom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:57 - 00:34:01]** And he's going to step to the side of the Yosuke inside.

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:04]** So now these two are standing right at the scanner area.

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:07]** It is now Torme's turn.

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:37]** uh and just for the listener because we are an audio only podcast uh termay you are kind of straight up and zigzagged again uh and we have spot thaddeus and rolu are just at that t kind of to the left side thaddeus is in a clear eyesight straight ahead and then we have rolu and choc kind of hiding around the corner um you don't know that jason that's all sure i was wasn't even listening


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:44]** So I think I can, um, hit them with the, what's my, what's your, who's it?

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:52]** The, uh, my frost bite class zero pistol within range of 60 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:52 - 00:35:14]** okay so i think i have a little bit of cover i'm not sure mechanically how that should i would say that is that's actually going to be a full cover because that's the way it's you're shooting between two walls kind of yeah pinched um so he's gonna get a plus four to his ac yes and you're targeting the human to the left


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:19]** Actually, I think I'm going to do what I did last time, which was herring fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:21]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:27]** So then the next person to attack them should have a bonus.

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:30]** And I think the DC is lower, if I'm not mistaken.

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:31]** It's only 15, I believe.

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:32]** Okay, great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:34]** No matter what, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:36]** Cover doesn't count towards herring fire.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:37]** I got a 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:40]** Beautiful.

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:42]** So take note, whoever's next.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:44]** that you get a plus two.

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:49]** I think you should hit him where it hurts, guys.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:51]** Start blasting.

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:51]** Copy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:54]** All right.

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:56]** It is now that next Yusuke's turn.

**[00:35:57 - 00:36:03]** And again, I just love how dice rolls lead the story is that I was going to ask Jason, who do you send in first?

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:07]** Do you march in first and lead or do you send in the underlings?

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:09]** But the dice decided the underlings go first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:13]** The underlings go first to soak up the fire and then Joe Trubel will come in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:34]** finish finish things off exactly so the second Yusuke he's gonna he's gonna walk up and and kind of shimmy between those two standing at the scanner awkwardly and he looks up at that turret and he's just like uh and then he's gonna cut to the right oh I think that's the end of his turn went to the right I can barely see him Rolu what are you doing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:38]** Rolo's back is up against the wall facing Thaddeus.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:39]** I'm not even looking in that direction.

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:47]** And then Rolo's going to peek and look around the corner and see these two, the Yusuke and the true warrior.

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:51]** Terme, you shot, which one did you use herring fire on?

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:51]** The one on the left?

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:54]** Yeah, I think so.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:54]** Okay.

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:55]** Yeah.

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:55]** All right.

**[00:36:55 - 00:37:01]** Then Rolo's going to take a shot with the... Hit the one on the left.

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:23]** copy right all right yeah anyways that one's stage right not right yeah okay copy uh and is going to fire with the azimuth serpent laser one shot at that dude or dude at that is a 23 against eac

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:42]** that wait which one are you firing at sorry the one on the left oh the okay so the one that got shot on the left yeah oh the herring fire right yeah that makes sense uh yeah that hits sweet okay that is a super strong nine points of fire damage from the serpent laser okay yes i have to do math now

**[00:37:43 - 00:38:11]** all right and then that's my turn for now because i realized i can't shoot moosh or moo shoot moo so uh i'm in front of thaddeus for the moment where is shock at shock is on your shoulder looks like he is on my shoulder oh yeah this is another thing for you jason is that chalk chalk is a raxalite so he's a tiny creature and we we've ruled that he's allowed to stay mounted on somebody's shoulder as long as he spins his move action to do so great so yep

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:13]** All right, that's my turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:14]** Cool.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:15]** Rolo, you're done.

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:16]** It's just convenient.

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:17]** Chak is right after you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:22]** I actually really like narratively that we had the same initiative role.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:23]** Yeah.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:25]** So we're acting at the same time.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:28]** Chak is going to do the same thing Rolo did.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:34]** He's going to take a shot at that house left true warrior.


## Speaker_0

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:34]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:35]** House left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:39]** There it is.

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:40]** He was jostled in that movement, though.

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:45]** He only rolled a three, no, a five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:46]** Against KAC?

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:47]** EAC.

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:48]** That's probably not.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:50]** Because EAC is lower.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:52]** That's not right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:53]** Okay.

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:53]** Yeah, no.

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:54]** That was a hope and a prayer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:57]** Yep, that's fine.

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:57]** Cool.

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:58]** All right.

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:59]** All right.

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:03]** It is now Tez Tronin's turn.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:09]** She is second in command of the True Warriors here on Akiton and in Kafak Depot.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:15]** She is going to march up and pass these guys and ends up right underneath that turret.


## Speaker_0

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:16]** Ooh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:35]** and then she's gonna charge using uh sorry i forget what the term is stellar rush is that right yes so she can use a charge action but she doesn't get the penalties uh for charge and then she can use a melee attack

**[00:39:35 - 00:40:05]** After that so she is going to do she can move up to twice her speed, so she's gonna end up right in front of Rolu yep, and it's the it's stars and stripes from the old Marvel vs. Capcom And as right as she gets up to you She's gonna take out her moat of energy or the motive energy that's kind of trailing behind her as the as everything fades off for the fire fades away It's gonna light her up

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:08]** as she lights up her stellar weapon.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:11]** And just the sword kind of... Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:13]** So cool.

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:13]** It's hilarious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:15]** Grows out of her fist.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:17]** And she's going to strike you.

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:19]** Well, that's freaking neat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:21]** I also like that Rulo has the worst eyesight.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:26]** So as Tez comes in in the sunlight, Rulo's trying to make out who that is and then recognizes Tez.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:29]** But at that moment, Tez supercharges forward.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:30]** And it's in front of me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:32]** It didn't have to go this way.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:39]** And she stabs you right in the gut for a... Sorry.

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:39]** Does a 28 hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:40]** Oh, come on.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:42]** Yeah, of course a 28 hits.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:45]** Great.

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:46]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:47]** Ooh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:40:47 - 00:41:16]** for how much damage nine points of damage for nine points of damage wow that is actually a lot uh i'm going to use my safeguard precog as my reaction did i take my reaction this turn i don't think i did uh where i can reduce some of the damage by five so i'm going to reduce it by five because i make quote unquote minute dexterous moves to protect myself from harm so i definitely kind of see that for a second he thought that there might be a


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:30]** hit to the gut so i'll take four points of damage this time and i've used a paradox and just uh since that is the end of my turn it is one of her special abilities i'm gonna roll it's supposed to be 1d3 right because she's an npc

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:34]** All right, so it's two rounds until she is fully attuned because she is a Salarian.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:37]** So we'll try to remember that.

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:39]** I don't know how to mark this on my thing.

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:41]** Two rounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:45]** You know, we can put a number in World 20 in one of those red dots.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:45]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:47]** That's a thing?

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:47]** Yeah.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:52]** If you don't know the red dot and then just type a number, it'll come up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:53]** It says 16 right now.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:53]** I don't know why.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:54]** No, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:57]** Like, you know, those condition red dots.

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:58]** Yeah.

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:00]** You can put a number inside of this.

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:01]** Wait, how?

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:03]** I think you just... It's been a while.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:05]** I think if you just... Yeah, there it is.

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:06]** I can't see that.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:06]** Nice.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:07]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:11]** I'm not using the red circle above her anyway, so I'll just use that.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:12]** Okay, fair enough.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:13]** I'm a simpleton.

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:14]** I don't...

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:16]** It's small, sure.

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:19]** All right, so that is the end of Tez Tronin's turn.

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:21]** Thaddeus, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:30]** Thaddeus sees that glowing sword go into Rollu, and a shock, just a moment of happiness, but then realization that he can't die, not yet, Rollu can't die yet.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:35]** And then he thinks, he's really scared, he's like, I've never fought a Salarian before.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:43]** But then he steps out to the right, or to the left, I should say, behind Rollu and says, big mistake.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:47]** and then fires with his Tactical Formium Venom Caster.

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:50]** That's a 19 to hit.

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:55]** But I think that... Do I get a bonus from the Herring Fire?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:57]** No, it only goes to the person who got fired next.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:58 - 00:42:58]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:42:59 - 00:42:59]** Someone did go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:00]** 19?

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:01]** And that's EAC or KAC?

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:03]** That's EAC or KAC, right?

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:06]** That does hit.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:06]** Fantastic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:12]** That's 11 points of damage on our Solarian friend.

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:13]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:17]** Jason, you're going to keep track of your own health because I'm terrible with math.

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:18]** That's fine.

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:20]** Cool.

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:22]** I believe that that math is correct.

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:22]** Okay.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:24]** That's the end of your turn.

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:27]** And it is now Dotru Lu's turn.

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:30]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:40]** So Trulu's got, at this point, I think, starting off, well, as he's moving in to the ship, he's got a dashko in two hands and a crossbalter in two more hands.

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:46]** And even though this art has him wielding two dashkos, at this point, I think I've got a range weapon out too.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:51]** I think I just barely can't quite make it to this turret.

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:54]** So he gives a little charge here.

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:56]** forward to end up right in front of it.

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:58]** Cool.

**[00:43:58 - 00:43:59]** Huge.

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:00]** That's big.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:07]** As he's going in, because the door in the front, there's one door open and one door shut, and that means nothing to no true.

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:11]** He just kind of pushes it out and crinkles it out of his way as he kind of just marches.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:15]** And then brings the Joshko down on top of the turret.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:17]** Oh, dang.

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:19]** Go ahead, give me an attack roll for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:20]** Sure thing.

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:23]** An 18 against EAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:25]** All right, and roll damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:27]** I will.

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:30]** 11 light, fiery flame damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:32]** I'm just going to say that's enough to kill it.

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:33]** Is that okay?

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:34]** Does anybody want to argue that?

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:36]** Yeah, I don't— I didn't— That wasn't good.

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:37]** Oh, Kevin, no.

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:39]** Yeah, it's dead.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:39]** It's dead.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:40]** Boom.

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:42]** Killed it in one strike.

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:46]** Chops, he actually just clean cuts it straight out of the sky because that thing's hanging from the ceiling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:48]** Oh, it's hanging from the ceiling.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:51]** Is this what was giving you so much trouble?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:53]** Yeah, that thing was scary.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:57]** No, not the turret.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:59]** That's down and on the ground.

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:06]** As he does that, you see some nectar starting to run down Chuck's legs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:08]** All over the puck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:10]** Thaddeus' hair just flares out on his body.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:12]** Oh, right.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:14]** That is the end of round number one.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:18]** I can delete that five that I was worried about earlier.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:19]** It's Yusuke's turn.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:21]** The first Yusuke.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:28]** And he's just going to scramble underneath Dotrulu's legs and dart off to the left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:30]** They are moving around.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:31]** They're trying to flank us.

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:32]** Watch out.

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:33]** They're trying to surround us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:39]** And then the next true warrior is going to kind of do the same thing, except go to the right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:43]** Two stage left, one stage right.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:45]** Yeah.

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:45]** Eyes open.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:47]** The truth is right in front of us.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:48]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:50]** Yeah.

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:53]** Also, there's this Salarian to take care of.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:54]** Oh, right.

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:55]** Torme, what are you doing?

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:56]** It is your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:58 - 00:46:02]** If it's going to end anywhere, I guess it's fine.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:04]** We put up a good fight.

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:06]** I'm going to put up a good one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:08]** Boy, are you giving up already?

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:08]** I'm not giving up.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:09]** I'm just saying.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:10]** To me.

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:13]** They'll truly might have that effect, but hang in there, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:17]** Let's finish this off as quickly as possible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:21]** Uh, and, uh, he's gonna try and shoot the Solarian that he can see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:22]** Oh, there's so many.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:24]** Oh.

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:26]** Very, very not good places.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:28]** I don't know if that's gonna do it.

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:30]** That's a, uh... What's the bonus on that?

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:31]** Oh, maybe.

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:31]** 18?

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:33]** 18 hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:34]** Against EAC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:37]** Uh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:38]** That hits.

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:38]** Oh.

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:39]** Yeah.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:40]** Uh, uh, uh, uh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:41 - 00:47:07]** nice all right for me from down the field target is five points of damage from the five points class zero pistol right zero uh she doesn't really even flinch when she gets hit uh it hits her almost it almost like bounces off her shield a little bit but it it hits i'm saying that i'm not saying there's any kind of dr or anything um you're just saying she's pretty healthy

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:08]** Yeah.

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:10]** I'm saying she's tough.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:13]** She's a true warrior.

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:16]** She's a true warrior.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:16]** Wow.

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:19]** It's now the other Yusoki's turn.

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:22]** And you guys cannot see him.

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:24]** So ignore this.

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:26]** He's going to run to the end of the hall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:29]** Okay.

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:30]** I'll just ignore that.

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:34]** Won't pay attention to it or note it at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:35]** Okay.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:37]** Sorry, that was probably one too many.

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:38]** Cool.

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:40]** That is the end of that Yasuki's turn.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:41]** Rolu, you're up.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:42]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:48]** Rolu is confused by Tez's comment saying it didn't have to be this way.

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:58]** And Rolu takes a step back and says, if I recall, I believe I said that without you here, it would be a lot easier.

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:04]** And then Rolu is going to take a five foot step back and

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:12]** And I think Rolu is just engaged in that part of the movie where it's just like one, you know, like just one person against one person.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:21]** And Rolu is totally just trying to face down Tez and is going to take another shot and see how far his azimuth serpent laser will go.

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:27]** That shot is going to be a 13 against EAC against Tez.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:28]** Okay.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:28]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:48]** Is so it hits Sorry Okay, yeah, I was like switching screens so 13 to EAC so you step back Take a clean shot at her and she kind of just like lifts her blade up Looks you in the eye and blocks your shot.

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:50]** It's almost slowly.

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:53]** She just like sees it coming and just chops it in half and


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:54]** Wow, cool.

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:59]** I mean, it is cool, but... That's like a free intimidation check, so that's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:03]** You want to just add Shaken to your condition list?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:05]** I'll just roll it for me, like I'm the player from Shaken.

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:06]** That's fine.

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:08]** All right, that is Rulu's turn for now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:09]** Chuck, it's your turn.

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:11]** Are you staying on his shoulder?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:20]** I am, and I'm going to shoot Test 200 right in the face with my Light Fast Fault Balesta.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:22]** Light, flash, fire, blaster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:24]** Light, flash, fire, blaster.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:28]** That is a six or a nine.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:29]** It's a nine.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:30]** So 14 to hit.

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:32]** EAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:33]** That's EAC.

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:36]** That also does not hit.

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:37]** Wow.

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:39]** So it's almost like you guys are just too close.

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:40]** She sees it coming.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:45]** She's able to strike his and then dodge yours.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:46]** Almost in the same movement.

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:49]** It's now her turn.

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:51]** She's going to step up.

**[00:49:51 - 00:50:04]** And she sees that chalk was the one that shot at her last and she's just gonna jab at you with her blade Almost as like she dodged your shot and just comes right clean for you.

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:14]** That is gonna be 26 to him Cool

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:16]** No?

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:16]** No?

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:16]** That's it?

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:18]** Oh, okay.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:19]** I'm just going to peace out.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:19]** Yes.

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:23]** That's nine points of slashing damage.

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:24]** That hurts.

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:25]** No, not the vines.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:26]** Wow.

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:27]** Cool.

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:27]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:28]** This might just be a TPK.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:29]** Yeah.

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:29]** That's it.

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:30]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:31]** That's what I'm going for.

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:33]** And that's going to be the end of her turn.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:35]** Thaddeus, you're up.

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:36]** What's next?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:37]** Good lord.

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:39]** Thaddeus just sweat drops.

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:44]** He thinks it's too risky to take a full attack, so he is just going to try to do another ranged attack.

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:48]** I thought you were going to do a full retreat.

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:48]** Shut up, man.

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:49]** Full draw!

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:50]** Run away!

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:53]** At the end of all things, just knew that I stood my ground until the end.

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:55]** It's a 14.

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:56]** KSE.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:57]** Say again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:58 - 00:50:59]** 14 KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:04]** I thought you were asking if my KAC was 14, and no, it's not.

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:05]** It's much higher than that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:09]** It's at least 17.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:09]** That's what we know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:11]** It's at least 14?

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:11]** I can tell you that.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:13]** Cool.

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:14]** That was your turn?

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:16]** That was your whole turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:19]** Are you done?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:20]** You moved and shot, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:21]** He's going to move.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:22]** He's just going to move.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:23]** Oh, no, you shot and then, okay.

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:26]** Can he do, I'm not sure if we already did a check on her.

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:32]** Could he try to like see if she has any particular like, she doesn't have any weaknesses actually now that I remember from like way back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:33]** She doesn't?

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:34]** Yeah, I don't remember if you guys did.

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:37]** You could do a free life science check if you have life science.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:38]** I don't know.

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:38]** I do actually.

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:39]** Hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:56]** oh okay good yeah you are 20 natural 20. that is 20. uh i forget what the e is it's 10 plus one and one half the c okay yeah that hits uh i'll give you one thing do you have anything particularly want to know


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:58]** Like how to kill her more easily.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:00]** Something like that.

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:03]** You find her therapist notes and you're like, ooh.

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:05]** A list of all of her worst fears.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:07]** Maybe something like that.

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:08]** Just things that she's working through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:13]** I'll give you that she doesn't have any weaknesses or any kind of resistances.

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:14]** So, okay.

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:16]** It's just a clean straight fight with her.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:18]** Yeah.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:19]** That's all you get from that.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:22]** Perhaps a health point estimation or something like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:38]** too late thaddeus is going to move a little bit further back then and just get ready to pop out for another attack later so he's near now the dead tough warrior next to jermaine got him yeah okay jason dr lou is up


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:49]** Don't you know, comes lumbering down this middle hallway, not caring that he's stepping over the bodies of his former gang members.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:53]** Does he step over them or does he just step on them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:57]** He's kind of stepping on them, I guess, you know, there's some crunching of bone.

**[00:52:58 - 00:53:12]** And I think he stops right there, not all the way behind Testron, just about 10 feet behind her, and aims the cross bolter.

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:14]** Oh, God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:33]** at somebody who's gonna get shot um yeah there's no truth i'm sorry i put a picture up because i just want to point out he's got like bare feet so as he's as he's stepping on their bodies i feel like he almost uses a finger to feel like tickle their faces too creepy even for me


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:37]** Kevin said some interesting stuff we should have said ahead of time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:43]** He takes his foot and puts it into like a shushing gesture to put a shush on the dead guys.

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:44]** You rest now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:45]** Closes their eyes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:48]** Yeah, there you go.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:50]** So who are you targeting?

**[00:53:50 - 00:54:15]** um i i am a little conf uh dr was a little confused about seeing this tiny plant what is that a tiny plant man but uh seeing the cassava uh and says who are you calling a fan oh i'm sorry sorry oh look i respect your pronouns 100 you're a raccoon um and but sees the cassava and goes you

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:19]** You lot from beyond the stars come down here.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:21]** You are going to take over Akaton.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:24]** I remember this from decades past.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:27]** You think you own this place.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:28]** I own this place.

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:34]** And he fires the crossbow at, sorry, what was the character?

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:34]** Rolu.

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:35]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:36]** Cool.

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:37]** Well, that's Rolu.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:39]** That's his whole life.

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:40]** That's it.

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:41]** Yeah.

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:42]** Please tell me Rolu's not down.

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:44]** I haven't rolled yet.

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:45]** I could roll a 10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:46]** Why do you care, Kelly?

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:47]** I rolled a 10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:50]** Oh, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:51]** You rolled a 10.

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:53]** Will can cast Grey Words on him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:54]** Oh, thank God.

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:56]** I rolled an 11 against your KSC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:57]** 11 against KAC.

**[00:54:57 - 00:55:02]** That unfortunately does not hit, but you weren't that far off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:10]** Here's a rules question that I'm not sure if you would know, but Dotrulu is a large character, so he's taking up four squares.

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:15]** Does he get soft cover, or is there soft cover because Testronin is standing in the way?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:24]** Um, I, I, I kind of play less fast and use with soft covers moves personally, uh, because it can be too fiddly, but like, I think probably.

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:25]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:29]** So either way it's a miss, but we'll deal with it.

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:30]** Cool.

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:31]** Well, that was a scream of rage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:34]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:38]** Okay, it is now the Yusoki's turns.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:41]** Turns, plural.

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:42]** There's multiple turns.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:49]** And this Yusoki is actually going to just dart past that hallway.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:51]** And that's the end of his turn.

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:54]** And this next Yusoki...

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:57]** Oh, sorry, nope, it's not the next T-shirt's turn.

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:58]** It is now the other true warrior's turn.

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:11]** He is gonna pop out of, he went through the storage room on the right where Rolu was just the last fight, and he pops out that door and he's gonna take a shot at Choc.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:19]** That is gonna be, oh, this is a 30-foot range, so it's gonna be a disadvantage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:21]** Wrong game, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:23]** That's not going to hit.

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:24]** Not disadvantage.

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:27]** I meant... Minus two.

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:29]** Yeah, minus two, because it's beyond range.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:32]** Or minus four, depending on how far beyond range.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:35]** Well, it's a nine to hit, so nine probably doesn't hit you, right?

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:36]** You see?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:37]** No?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:38]** Okay.

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:41]** When it comes out, he shoots, and it just kind of bounces off the walls.

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:43]** Termay, you're up.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:44]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:47]** Termay is seeing this lumbering.

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:48]** Whoa.

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:49]** He's quite big.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:54]** Here, maybe they can slow down with this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:54 - 00:57:00]** And he's going to toss a barbed shrapnel grenade, mark one.


## Speaker_0

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:01]** Whoa.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:02]** Whoa.


## Speaker_0

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:02]** Ooh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:10]** And the idea being... So I think, like, what I would need to do, because I don't want to hit Roloo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:11]** Don't you, though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:12]** Because I have to throw it.

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:14]** Probably have to hit it here, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:16]** I didn't see where you pinged on Rol20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:17]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:17]** Hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:21]** Just, like, right in between Deltarune and Tez.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:21]** Yeah.

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:22]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:27]** So that would raise the DC to 10, right?

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:29]** Because the range is 20.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:32]** The range of the attack or the range of the... The range of the...

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:49]** it's a dc5 to hit within your range and then you add uh plus two yeah if it's outside of your range dc so it'd be seven the range is 20 feet yeah so it'd be seven okay my question is how what is the radius on that explosion


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:51]** Does not say in my little thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:53]** But I'm guessing it's like five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:59]** You guys remember how much grenades slowed down the last time we tried to use them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:03]** We had a whole episode on grenades.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:04]** Yeah, bar shop or grenade.

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:09]** Yeah, I'm seeing a special explode 10 feet.

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:12]** Range 20 feet.

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:13]** 10 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:16]** Yeah, if you drop it right in front of, don't you do that.

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:19]** Yeah, that's what I'm going to hit for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:21]** I'm guessing you want to snap it to the corner.

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:21]** Good luck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:24]** Yeah, I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:27]** Wildly misses, bounces off the wall and hits Rolloo in the face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:31]** Come on, Will.

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:32]** You always roll high.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:33]** Please roll high this time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:56]** 18 actually You don't even throw it you just kind of underhand it and it's like ting ting ting ting ting ting it lands right between don't you lose left toes We both need to do a reflex save is that correct what is yes That's a nine on mine.

**[00:58:57 - 00:58:59]** So Tez Tez rolls a nine for reflex.

**[00:58:59 - 00:58:59]** Oh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:00]** I'm just going to get in the back.

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:04]** I got a 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:33]** um but i think yeah so it takes half and then now there's the embed property um so you have like barbed needles lingering effect on the target for the first time each round the target moves five feet or more in a single action voluntary or not it takes the listed damage target can remove the embedded object with the standard action dealing the listed damage in the process

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:51]** uh alternately with a successful medicine check of dc 15 plus one and a half the weapon item level so it's a one um another creature can remove the object from the target and deal no damage multiple embedded objects each deal their listed damage and must be removed one at a time okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:53]** So what is the current damage?

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:54]** So we don't take damage this time?

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:55]** We only take damage when we move?

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:56]** No, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:57]** You still take damage from the explosion.

**[00:59:57 - 01:00:02]** I think it's just the embed property, it continues to deal damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:04]** You take one more, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:07]** Yeah, you'll take a D6 each time you move five feet or more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:12]** Does that account for Dotrulu, or did the reflex save save you from the bomb?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:14]** No, I don't.

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:38]** i think often i think yeah if you make the save you don't take the secondary thing okay cool so i rolled a four i feel like it went into don't you don't you lose foot and then just clink just fell out yeah so it's neat let's stick in so to truly i think you take two points and um testosterone takes four and she's has the shrapnel embedded


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:44]** Okay, and it says embed for 1d6, so you're going to roll 1d6, and that's going to tell me how long it's embedded for?

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:46]** I don't... Or is that the damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:48]** No, it's embedded until it's removed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:52]** So that 1d6 is the damage for every turn?

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:52]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:52]** Yep.

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:55]** Each time that you move five feet.

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:55]** Ouch.

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:56]** Nice job.

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:57]** It's going to hurt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:58 - 01:00:59]** Thanks.

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:02]** It's the last one I had, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:03]** It was a good choice, man.

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:04]** All right.

**[01:01:04 - 01:01:06]** Glad you got that from Snakeboy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:11]** It is now the other Yosuke's turn.

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:24]** He is going to run up the side and go parallel with Thaddeus and take a shot with his semi-automatic pistol.

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:28]** Let's put the range on that.

**[01:01:28 - 01:01:29]** Not enough.

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:33]** It's only 30 foot range, so it's a minus two.

**[01:01:34 - 01:01:37]** And then it doesn't hit anyways because I rolled an eight on the dice.

**[01:01:37 - 01:01:38]** So it's a miss.

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:41]** He just down the hallway.

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:41]** Cool.

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:42]** That's the end of his turn.

**[01:01:42 - 01:01:43]** Rolu, you're up.

**[01:01:43 - 01:01:44]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:52]** This is just a complete explosion of senses for Rolu because it's versus Tez coming in and attacking and talking.

**[01:01:52 - 01:01:54]** And then it's still Trulu filling up the entire hallway.

**[01:01:54 - 01:01:59]** And then it's this barbed shrapnel explosion right in Rolu's face.

**[01:02:00 - 01:02:04]** And I think Rolu is ready to GTFO, for lack of a better term.

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:06]** He wants to step out of the situation.

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:11]** And knowing that Chak is on his shoulder, he wants to preserve Chak.

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:14]** And he wants to start to change the narrative here.

**[01:02:14 - 01:02:14]** THANKS FOR JOINING US.

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:37]** So all of this is going through Rolu's mind as Rolu just decides to take a guarded step to the right and then is going to, I think, incur an AOO if I can, because I want to get away and move 30 feet down the hall and pull focus away from Terme and split up this complete, you know, fish in a barrel situation here.

**[01:02:37 - 01:02:39]** No offense against fish.

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:40]** Yeah, splitting up is wise.

**[01:02:40 - 01:02:40]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:44]** You might be lucky on this one.

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:46]** That's a 19?

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:48]** 19 to hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:02:48 - 01:02:49]** Oh, that hits.

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:50]** That's a definite hit.

**[01:02:50 - 01:02:54]** Does that stop your movement?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:56 - 01:02:56]** No.

**[01:02:57 - 01:02:59]** Not unless you have a feat or something.

**[01:03:00 - 01:03:00]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:00 - 01:03:03]** That's a 13 points of slashing damage.

**[01:03:04 - 01:03:05]** 13 points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:05]** Wow.

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:10]** That's the last time I decided to voluntarily take a nail over here.

**[01:03:10 - 01:03:12]** I'm just not going to do that ever again.

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:12]** That was a mistake.

**[01:03:13 - 01:03:13]** All right.

**[01:03:13 - 01:03:16]** So I'm going to move 20 feet.

**[01:03:16 - 01:03:39]** down the hall to the right so it's so now i'm i'm in between uh this true warrior and i can't see do truly around the corner anymore and i run past termay termay i i i don't know what site this is of jack and rolu running past you uh this is wild they're booking it yeah that's we might try to i don't know


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:03:39 - 01:04:04]** we gotta we gotta face off with this guy somehow yeah yeah yeah just not being in front of both of them all right that's rolu's turn for now all right chalk you are up what are you doing i'm gonna spend a move action to stay with rolu uh and then i'm just gonna play his shoulder turret still and take a shot at the uh true warrior in that hallway

**[01:04:05 - 01:04:09]** Ooh, that is a 19 to hit.

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:10]** That is going to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:11]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:04:12 - 01:04:16]** You would think I would just keep a D4 on my desk.

**[01:04:16 - 01:04:20]** Oh, that's a five bludgeoning, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:43]** five bludgeoning damage towards the true warrior that just took a shot randomly at you guys so that is gonna be he's he's not doing well so i'll say termay you're up what are you doing um seeing the success of my shrapnel grenade i'm going to try and repeat the same thing uh but


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:43 - 01:04:48]** I'm going to throw a flash grenade this time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:48 - 01:04:49]** I did?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:49 - 01:04:49]** Yeah.

**[01:04:49 - 01:04:50]** I think you skipped a few turns.

**[01:04:51 - 01:04:51]** Yeah, you did.

**[01:04:53 - 01:04:53]** No.

**[01:04:54 - 01:04:54]** Wait, what?

**[01:04:54 - 01:04:57]** Because that grenade, I haven't gone since that first grenade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:57 - 01:05:00]** This is my problem with XL, so yes, you're right.

**[01:05:00 - 01:05:03]** So the human, I was editing the human's line.

**[01:05:03 - 01:05:05]** So now, so that was Choc's move.

**[01:05:05 - 01:05:07]** It is now Tez Tronin's turn.

**[01:05:07 - 01:05:08]** I apologize, Will.

**[01:05:08 - 01:05:09]** That was...

**[01:05:09 - 01:05:11]** I've got a lot going on.

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:12]** Cool.

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:14]** I need to figure out how this embed works.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:15 - 01:05:17]** So if you move, you get a D6.

**[01:05:18 - 01:05:18]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:18 - 01:05:19]** Right.

**[01:05:19 - 01:05:21]** Well, she is now fully attuned.

**[01:05:23 - 01:05:28]** And so she is going to step up right in front of Termay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:29 - 01:05:31]** Should I roll or do you want to roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:32 - 01:05:34]** Uh, yeah, give me one second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:05:35 - 01:05:37]** I think so, because she moved ten feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:37 - 01:05:39]** Yes, roll the, is it the 1d6?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:05:39 - 01:05:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:42 - 01:05:43]** While I look up what this tech does.

**[01:05:45 - 01:05:46]** Five points of damage?

**[01:05:46 - 01:05:48]** Ew.

**[01:05:48 - 01:05:48]** Ew.

**[01:05:49 - 01:05:53]** That's what my son says to everything.

**[01:05:53 - 01:05:54]** Uh, cool, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:54 - 01:05:56]** Hello, Tez Tronin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:56 - 01:06:13]** she so she kind of like she takes that step forward and she feels the shrapnel digging at her leg and then she looks you clean in the eye and i need you both to roll a reflex save thaddeus and germaine yeah yes okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:14 - 01:06:15]** I got a natural 20.

**[01:06:16 - 01:06:17]** I got an 8.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:17 - 01:06:18]** Good job.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:19 - 01:06:21]** That's probably for only half.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:21 - 01:06:23]** That's for half, yes.

**[01:06:23 - 01:06:24]** Oh, man.

**[01:06:24 - 01:06:26]** Sorry, Kelly, what did you roll?

**[01:06:27 - 01:06:28]** 8.

**[01:06:28 - 01:06:30]** So you take full damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:06:31 - 01:06:31]** That's a 4.

**[01:06:31 - 01:06:34]** 6, and it's 10.

**[01:06:35 - 01:06:36]** Solarian's full of tunes.

**[01:06:36 - 01:06:36]** 12.

**[01:06:37 - 01:06:37]** Right on ya.

**[01:06:38 - 01:06:39]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:39 - 01:06:40]** Yeah, make sure I'm reading that right.

**[01:06:40 - 01:06:41]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:06:41 - 01:06:42]** Kevin, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:42 - 01:06:44]** That's 15 points of damage.

**[01:06:45 - 01:06:47]** So you take seven points of damage, Will.

**[01:06:48 - 01:06:54]** And Kelly, you're going to take 15 points of fire damage as she looks you in the face and explodes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:58 - 01:07:00]** That's my girl.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:00 - 01:07:01]** Thaddeus, you're up.

**[01:07:01 - 01:07:01]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:07:02 - 01:07:04]** Thaddeus goes back 10 feet and fires at her.

**[01:07:05 - 01:07:06]** He needs to get out of range of this.

**[01:07:07 - 01:07:12]** With his Venom Caster, it's A14 to hit again, which doesn't hit, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:13 - 01:07:19]** I think you're almost like blinded and shook by that flame that you're just a little off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:07:19 - 01:07:21]** Yeah, he's putting out the fire on his fur right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:22 - 01:07:23]** Ooh.

**[01:07:24 - 01:07:26]** Doltrulu, it's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:26 - 01:07:27]** Okay.

**[01:07:27 - 01:07:27]** All right.

**[01:07:28 - 01:07:29]** I got to measure some distances here.

**[01:07:30 - 01:07:30]** All right.

**[01:07:31 - 01:07:32]** Let's do that.

**[01:07:33 - 01:07:34]** Come right up into the T juncture.

**[01:07:35 - 01:07:40]** Again, I think what we'll do here is... Yeah.

**[01:07:41 - 01:07:43]** The at...

**[01:07:43 - 01:07:56]** Rulu, from here, just sort of looking at you, and once again says, you got lucky last time, but this planet, this ship, and everything in it is mine.

**[01:07:57 - 01:08:01]** And here comes a demoralize check.

**[01:08:01 - 01:08:02]** Ooh, okay.

**[01:08:02 - 01:08:05]** Oh, wow, that's badass.

**[01:08:05 - 01:08:06]** Let's roll that intimidation.

**[01:08:07 - 01:08:09]** Ooh, that's a nat 20.

**[01:08:09 - 01:08:11]** So a big, big number.

**[01:08:12 - 01:08:14]** Yeah.

**[01:08:15 - 01:08:15]** There's no criticals.

**[01:08:16 - 01:08:16]** Oh, no.

**[01:08:17 - 01:08:18]** One round.

**[01:08:18 - 01:08:18]** Okay.

**[01:08:18 - 01:08:24]** So what is your, do you have any intimidate skill bonus?

**[01:08:24 - 01:08:26]** My intimidate skill bonus is three.

**[01:08:27 - 01:08:27]** Okay.

**[01:08:27 - 01:08:29]** Most likely 15 plus one and a half.

**[01:08:29 - 01:08:31]** Your CR is a little higher.

**[01:08:31 - 01:08:32]** You guys level four now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:08:32 - 01:08:33]** Yeah.

**[01:08:33 - 01:08:35]** So CR four, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:35 - 01:08:35]** Yeah.

**[01:08:35 - 01:08:38]** 21.

**[01:08:38 - 01:08:40]** You're shaking for the next two rounds.

**[01:08:40 - 01:08:41]** Woo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:08:41 - 01:08:42]** Yeah.

**[01:08:42 - 01:08:42]** Yeah.

**[01:08:42 - 01:08:43]** Okay.

**[01:08:43 - 01:08:43]** Cool.

**[01:08:44 - 01:08:45]** Yeah.

**[01:08:46 - 01:08:46]** Wow.

**[01:08:46 - 01:08:48]** I, John, don't even know what to say.

**[01:08:48 - 01:08:49]** I am shaken.

**[01:08:49 - 01:08:51]** I think I'm actually shaken now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:52 - 01:08:52]** Fair enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:53 - 01:08:53]** All right.

**[01:08:54 - 01:08:56]** God dang it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:56 - 01:09:00]** I'm doing the slow, lumbering, slowly coming at you bad guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:09:00 - 01:09:01]** That's intimidating.

**[01:09:02 - 01:09:02]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:02 - 01:09:07]** Michael, if he just, like, appeared around the corner of the... A little intimidating, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:07 - 01:09:08]** Sure, yeah.

**[01:09:08 - 01:09:11]** Yeah, just, like, wraps around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:09:11 - 01:09:19]** Like, especially with the dynamic lighting, you run away, and you sort of lose track of how big Dotrilo is, and then it's just this giant puck.

**[01:09:19 - 01:09:20]** Just coming out of the shadows.

**[01:09:20 - 01:09:21]** With flaming doshkos.

**[01:09:21 - 01:09:24]** Just like, oh, yeah, that's right, he's a big motherf***er.

**[01:09:24 - 01:09:25]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:25 - 01:09:30]** Okay, and in that time, I moved the first Yosuke True Warrior.

**[01:09:31 - 01:09:32]** He ran up the hall.

**[01:09:32 - 01:09:41]** You guys cannot see him, but just for the listener, he is up and around the corner on the other side of the glass looking into that server room.

**[01:09:43 - 01:09:45]** The other True Warrior's turn now, the human.

**[01:09:47 - 01:09:50]** He is going to put his pistol away.

**[01:09:50 - 01:09:52]** Oh, I can't.

**[01:09:52 - 01:09:53]** Oh, no, it's a free action to drop it.

**[01:09:53 - 01:10:02]** So he's just going to drop his pistol and he's going to step forward and he's going to whip out his baton as he walks forward and swing it at Rolu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:10:02 - 01:10:03]** At Rolu?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:10:03 - 01:10:05]** He can't see Chuck.

**[01:10:05 - 01:10:06]** Chuck's on your shoulder.

**[01:10:06 - 01:10:06]** It's not fair.

**[01:10:50 - 01:10:56]** forces throughout the universe and toss out an adamantine shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:10:57 - 01:10:59]** Nice.

**[01:10:59 - 01:11:00]** Where did this rule come from?

**[01:11:00 - 01:11:01]** Or this spell come from?

**[01:11:01 - 01:11:02]** Adamantine shot?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:03 - 01:11:03]** Yeah.

**[01:11:04 - 01:11:09]** Dwarves created adamantine shot to turn common ammunition into deadly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:09 - 01:11:10]** It's galactic magic, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:11 - 01:11:12]** Sorry?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:12 - 01:11:13]** It's from galactic magic?

**[01:11:13 - 01:11:13]** Yes.

**[01:11:14 - 01:11:16]** This is my least favorite spell.

**[01:11:16 - 01:11:16]** It's terrible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:11:18 - 01:11:19]** It's a great spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:20 - 01:11:20]** All right.

**[01:11:20 - 01:11:27]** So I get three attacks against your KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:11:28 - 01:11:28]** Uh-huh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:29 - 01:11:33]** So that's a... Extra magic missile.

**[01:11:33 - 01:11:34]** Yeah, it's terrible.

**[01:11:35 - 01:11:36]** It's awesome.

**[01:11:36 - 01:11:38]** I don't think I get any bonus, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:38 - 01:11:39]** We were playing it wrong in the beginning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:39 - 01:11:43]** I think you get your attack bonus, I believe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:44 - 01:11:44]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:45 - 01:11:46]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:46 - 01:12:01]** when we first were using in the earlier portion of this game, we were using it as if it was a Like a modification to somebody else's weapon Yeah, so he was he was touching somebody's weapon and that was giving them the adamantine shot and then we realize no it just says like you pull out something and shoot it like

**[01:12:01 - 01:12:03]** Yeah, which makes it even worse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:03 - 01:12:08]** Okay, key ability score in place of... So that is... Oh, 20.

**[01:12:09 - 01:12:10]** All right.

**[01:12:10 - 01:12:11]** You have to roll.

**[01:12:11 - 01:12:12]** Yeah, you have to roll.

**[01:12:13 - 01:12:14]** Okay, 20 again.

**[01:12:14 - 01:12:15]** Wait, 20 is your bonus?

**[01:12:16 - 01:12:19]** I'm using my charisma because it's my key ability score.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:20 - 01:12:20]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:20 - 01:12:22]** And a 16.

**[01:12:24 - 01:12:25]** So two 20s and a 16.

**[01:12:26 - 01:12:27]** Dirty 20s.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:27 - 01:12:29]** And this is against K's.

**[01:12:29 - 01:12:29]** Yes.

**[01:12:30 - 01:12:30]** Wait.

**[01:12:30 - 01:12:31]** It's a dirty 20.

**[01:12:31 - 01:12:32]** God, sorry.

**[01:12:33 - 01:12:34]** So those first two are going to hit.

**[01:12:34 - 01:12:34]** Give me damage.

**[01:12:34 - 01:12:35]** The third one misses.

**[01:12:36 - 01:12:37]** Holy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:37 - 01:12:39]** Wow.

**[01:12:39 - 01:12:41]** I got an eight and a four.

**[01:12:42 - 01:12:44]** So 12 points total.

**[01:12:45 - 01:12:45]** Nice.

**[01:12:45 - 01:12:46]** Dope.

**[01:12:46 - 01:12:46]** Good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:48 - 01:12:52]** I really wanted to save that for him, though, but... So that's your standard action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:53 - 01:12:53]** Yeah.

**[01:12:53 - 01:12:54]** Do you want to move now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:54 - 01:12:55]** Yeah, I took that guard and step.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:55 - 01:12:56]** Oh, you did a guard and step.

**[01:12:56 - 01:12:56]** Okay.

**[01:12:57 - 01:12:58]** Good, good, good.

**[01:12:59 - 01:13:00]** It is the other Yusuke's turn.

**[01:13:00 - 01:13:01]** He is in shot of you.

**[01:13:01 - 01:13:04]** He just saw you do that, and he's like, what the hell?

**[01:13:04 - 01:13:12]** And he's going to move up, so he's within... He's now within range to hit you without incurring a penalty.

**[01:13:13 - 01:13:13]** Yep.

**[01:13:13 - 01:13:15]** That's going to be...

**[01:13:16 - 01:13:17]** 11 to hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:13:18 - 01:13:19]** Nah, that's a miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:13:20 - 01:13:20]** Yeah, okay.

**[01:13:20 - 01:13:23]** So he steps forward and he shoots off his semi-automatic pistol and misses.

**[01:13:24 - 01:13:25]** Rolu, you're up.

**[01:13:25 - 01:13:25]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:25 - 01:13:27]** Just shoots the body in front of me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:13:30 - 01:13:35]** This true warrior came up behind Rolu and, you know, misses.

**[01:13:35 - 01:13:38]** And I think the combination of the clang of the...

**[01:13:38 - 01:13:45]** the myths and Dotrulu's words about how they control the ship, how this is theirs.

**[01:13:45 - 01:13:53]** Because I think when Rolu first saw Dotrulu and he made the comment about Kasathans, it like froze him.

**[01:13:53 - 01:14:11]** and now he is pulled out of it and he realizes what who he has to be he takes a guarded step forward and he says dotrulu we are the free captains this ship and kafak depot will never be yours

**[01:14:11 - 01:14:23]** And Rulu's going to cast Day's weariness on you and just pull forth all of the fatigue and exhaust that can happen in 24 hours staying up straight.

**[01:14:23 - 01:14:29]** And you need to make a DC 15 will save.

**[01:14:29 - 01:14:30]** Will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:14:30 - 01:14:32]** Will save.

**[01:14:32 - 01:14:33]** Will save.

**[01:14:33 - 01:14:33]** Will save.

**[01:14:34 - 01:14:35]** Do the will save.

**[01:14:35 - 01:14:36]** I got a 25.

**[01:14:37 - 01:14:38]** Oh, the will on this guy.

**[01:14:39 - 01:14:40]** Yeah.

**[01:14:40 - 01:14:41]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:14:41 - 01:14:41]** I figured.

**[01:14:41 - 01:14:42]** All right, that's fine.

**[01:14:42 - 01:14:43]** He's like the boss.

**[01:14:44 - 01:14:44]** Yeah.

**[01:14:44 - 01:14:45]** Oh, yeah, of course.

**[01:14:45 - 01:14:54]** It is still half damage of 4d8, which this is going to be 10 points of damage to you.

**[01:14:55 - 01:14:56]** Is that the first damage on Dotrulu?

**[01:14:56 - 01:14:57]** I think it is.

**[01:14:57 - 01:14:58]** I took a little trap.

**[01:14:58 - 01:14:59]** Took a little trap.

**[01:14:59 - 01:14:59]** That's right.

**[01:15:00 - 01:15:00]** That's right.

**[01:15:00 - 01:15:01]** That's right.

**[01:15:01 - 01:15:02]** A little bit.

**[01:15:02 - 01:15:03]** A little bit.

**[01:15:03 - 01:15:04]** And then it fell out.

**[01:15:04 - 01:15:08]** Ten points of damage to you.

**[01:15:08 - 01:15:15]** You successfully had the wool save, and you negate the fatigued condition that was about to be onset.

**[01:15:17 - 01:15:18]** Oh, man.

**[01:15:18 - 01:15:18]** Wow.

**[01:15:19 - 01:15:20]** That is Rolo's turn for now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:15:21 - 01:15:22]** All right.

**[01:15:22 - 01:15:24]** That was pretty impressive, Rolo.

**[01:15:25 - 01:15:26]** Chalk, you're up.

**[01:15:26 - 01:15:27]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:15:28 - 01:15:30]** First, I'm going to spend a move action to stay on Rolo's shoulder.

**[01:15:31 - 01:15:36]** And then I'm going to start yelling at Dotrulu.

**[01:15:39 - 01:15:42]** You big greedy monster.

**[01:15:43 - 01:15:44]** You don't scare us.

**[01:15:45 - 01:15:50]** Using his not-in-the-face ability.

**[01:15:50 - 01:15:52]** So make a DC 15.

**[01:15:53 - 01:15:55]** We'll save.

**[01:15:55 - 01:15:55]** We'll save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:15:55 - 01:15:56]** We'll save.

**[01:15:57 - 01:15:58]** We'll save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:15:58 - 01:16:00]** Come on, I fail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:16:01 - 01:16:02]** Whoa.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:16:02 - 01:16:27]** i yeah only 12. awesome you are you have been unduly influenced by this rutabaga um so uh mechanically any attacks against uh chak from dotrulu will take a minus four penalty to ac or excuse me you might have four penalties to the attack nice it's a classic rolo shot good cop back up that's what it is yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:16:27 - 01:16:28]** So that's a standard action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:16:29 - 01:16:30]** That's a move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:16:30 - 01:16:32]** But you already used your move action to stay on Rotlu?

**[01:16:32 - 01:16:33]** Yeah.

**[01:16:33 - 01:16:34]** So that is your turn.

**[01:16:34 - 01:16:35]** Okay.

**[01:16:36 - 01:16:37]** It is now Tess Tronin's turn.

**[01:16:38 - 01:16:42]** She is going to turn back towards Nottrulu.

**[01:16:42 - 01:16:46]** She looks him in the eye and she affirms, like, I am not out of this fight.

**[01:16:47 - 01:16:48]** And she stabs herself in the leg.

**[01:16:49 - 01:16:50]** Oh, okay, good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:16:50 - 01:16:52]** That was going to be really confusing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:16:52 - 01:16:54]** Yeah, that was good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:16:54 - 01:16:55]** You had me there on the first half.


## Speaker_0

**[01:16:55 - 01:16:55]** True.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:16:55 - 01:16:57]** She stabs him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:16:57 - 01:16:59]** Right in the face.

**[01:16:59 - 01:17:08]** And then she is going to... She's going to move back behind Dotrulu.

**[01:17:08 - 01:17:09]** Dude.

**[01:17:09 - 01:17:10]** She was just reassuring.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:17:10 - 01:17:14]** What a wild... Okay, stop me if this is... Because I can cut this in post.

**[01:17:15 - 01:17:23]** What a wild ending to the book it would be if Tez Tronin betrays Dotrulu and like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:17:23 - 01:17:24]** Man, I didn't write that in.

**[01:17:24 - 01:17:25]** That would have been fantastic.

**[01:17:25 - 01:17:26]** Takes over.

**[01:17:26 - 01:17:29]** If she's a part of a free captains the whole time, like she is.

**[01:17:31 - 01:17:32]** You guys were late.

**[01:17:32 - 01:17:34]** She stabbed him in the back.

**[01:17:34 - 01:17:35]** Oh man, I should have done that.

**[01:17:36 - 01:17:37]** I didn't do that.

**[01:17:37 - 01:17:38]** That's not happening.

**[01:17:40 - 01:17:41]** Thaddeus, you're up.

**[01:17:41 - 01:17:41]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:17:42 - 01:17:42]** My goodness.

**[01:17:43 - 01:17:50]** Seeing the lieutenant of Dotrulu retreat, Thaddeus comes around and sneers at the Ahsoki that shot him earlier.

**[01:17:50 - 01:17:52]** Let's take out the adds.

**[01:17:53 - 01:17:54]** And he fires.

**[01:17:54 - 01:17:56]** It's a 21 to hit.

**[01:17:56 - 01:17:57]** Against the Yosuke?

**[01:17:57 - 01:18:00]** Four for the Yosuke for 11 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:18:01 - 01:18:23]** i think i imagine it goes into its nose this time i usually hit the eyes okay that's 11 points of damage you said yes you like almost take his head off it tears through his ear rips off half his face his skull is showing oh my god but he's still he just dead eyes you


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:18:24 - 01:18:24]** Cool.

**[01:18:24 - 01:18:25]** Very tough.

**[01:18:25 - 01:18:26]** Very high will, I see.

**[01:18:27 - 01:18:29]** Yeah, wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:18:29 - 01:18:32]** That was a good turn, but it is now Dotru's.

**[01:18:33 - 01:18:34]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:18:35 - 01:18:36]** Well, now you've made me mad.

**[01:18:38 - 01:18:43]** And he gets to get right up in the face of this pair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:18:44 - 01:18:47]** Yusuke's face is my favorite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:18:48 - 01:19:09]** going on up there i don't know what's going on you can't you can't you made me you made me bleed my own blood no one makes white goodman bleed his own blood and i am going to bring that dashcode down now so uh i have i i don't want to attack the braxler right because that's because you said not in my face


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:19:10 - 01:19:13]** He could attack the Raxalite, but correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:19:13 - 01:19:15]** I'm just saying, that's what I take a penalty for.

**[01:19:16 - 01:19:21]** You're looking at the Raxalite like, oh, little potted plant there you got.

**[01:19:21 - 01:19:21]** Very nice.

**[01:19:23 - 01:19:25]** Very nice.

**[01:19:25 - 01:19:48]** watch me roll good all right uh 23. against look against against yeah yeah that's that's a hit oh all right here it comes sorry everyone uh that's 17 damage okay what okay that's i think my maximum uh you all right there man


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:19:48 - 01:19:55]** Yeah, I would say describe your takedown there, Jason, because Rolu goes down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:19:56 - 01:20:02]** Okay, just again, maybe, you don't need both those arms.

**[01:20:03 - 01:20:05]** Oh, but it's not critical.

**[01:20:05 - 01:20:17]** So technically not the wounding property, but essentially just slashing at your arms and just big burns and cuts down one side of your body as you tumble to the ground.

**[01:20:18 - 01:20:19]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:20:19 - 01:20:21]** I'm down.

**[01:20:22 - 01:20:25]** Rolu falls to the ground, just crumples underneath Choc.

**[01:20:26 - 01:20:31]** And it's like Choc has inertia that's just holding him up in the air just a little bit, like a cartoon.

**[01:20:31 - 01:20:34]** And then he looks down, and that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:20:37 - 01:20:37]** Way to go.

**[01:20:38 - 01:20:38]** Wow.

**[01:20:38 - 01:20:38]** Who?

**[01:20:39 - 01:20:39]** Wow.

**[01:20:39 - 01:20:40]** Who's dead?

**[01:20:41 - 01:20:41]** All right.

**[01:20:42 - 01:20:43]** We're all going to die.

**[01:20:43 - 01:20:43]** This is it.

**[01:20:43 - 01:20:44]** We're all going to die.

**[01:20:44 - 01:20:45]** Yeah.

**[01:20:45 - 01:20:45]** Easy.

**[01:20:45 - 01:20:46]** Got to hang down there, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:20:47 - 01:20:47]** Yeah.

**[01:20:47 - 01:20:50]** This is maybe an unfair fight.

**[01:20:50 - 01:20:57]** Just so you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:20:57 - 01:20:59]** Thanks for listening, you scallywags.

**[01:21:00 - 01:21:05]** Until next week, drift begones on Distant Stars.
