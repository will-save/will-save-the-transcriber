**[00:00:01 - 00:00:12]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:13]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:15]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:16]** Get out.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:19]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:22]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:23 - 00:00:30]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:33]** unknown treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:00:56 - 00:01:00]** Welcome back to We'll Save in the Interstellar Tales of the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:01:01 - 00:01:01]** I am Kevin Decker.

**[00:01:01 - 00:01:03]** I am your GM.

**[00:01:03 - 00:01:04]** What?

**[00:01:04 - 00:01:04]** You are?

**[00:01:04 - 00:01:05]** What?

**[00:01:05 - 00:01:06]** I am your GM, yes.

**[00:01:06 - 00:01:07]** Oh, that's so cool.

**[00:01:07 - 00:01:08]** I feel so lucky.

**[00:01:08 - 00:01:13]** I've titled myself the Junk Master on a couple of different platforms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:13 - 00:01:14]** Junk Master.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:01:14 - 00:01:15]** Yeah, because we're playing Junker's Delight.

**[00:01:15 - 00:01:16]** I think it's appropriate.

**[00:01:16 - 00:01:17]** It's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:17 - 00:01:18]** I'm the Junk Master.

**[00:01:18 - 00:01:20]** You don't have any junk in your shop, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:01:20 - 00:01:22]** You just have junk in your trunk.

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:23]** You don't think all this is junk back here?


## Speaker_0

**[00:01:24 - 00:01:24]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:01:24 - 00:01:26]** Half of it's junk.

**[00:01:26 - 00:01:27]** Nobody wants that.

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:29]** It's a collection of random junk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:29 - 00:01:31]** Nobody wants to see that.

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:36]** Two minutes on video so everyone can see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:01:36 - 00:01:39]** Well, guys, Thanksgiving was this last weekend.

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:40]** How was it?

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:41]** Everybody have a good time?

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:43]** You're supposed to have a good time for Thanksgiving, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:44]** Green beans were great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:47]** Yeah, it was dope.

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:48]** I smoked a turkey.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:49]** Smoked a turkey.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:50]** And it was great.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:53]** It's the first time I've actually smoked a turkey on my smoker.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:54]** Oh, that's cool.

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:56]** So it's one of those like I'm doing this.

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:59]** I did a seasoning and I injected it.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:02]** So it's just like an explosion of flavor in every bite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:07]** I hate when you start talking about food because I get really hungry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:10]** I love food in case it's not immediately obvious.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:12]** I always drag us back to food.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:15]** Let's be real about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:17]** I haven't had Vinny's food for all this food talk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:19]** I'm actually big talk.

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:21]** I'm a terrible cook, but you guys have no idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:45]** yeah that's not true dude dude i think it's great oh that's true you have had my i also still don't believe that you're a giant so um oh yeah because have you have you not met him in person i still didn't we share the video that is the four of us without kev and just how tall we are and then there's probably somebody else in the shot so they can just say we needed a banana for skill just for reference yeah then there is the other shot of me with the three the three of you yes and showing that i'm half your size yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:46]** Um, okay.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:49]** All that aside, I am very thankful to be here with you guys.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:51]** Um, talking about food though.

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:57]** My, my, I went to, uh, my, my, my wife's grandparents house.

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:57]** Sorry.

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:59]** I was like, I'm not sure exactly how to say that.

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:05]** My grandparent-in-laws, um, you know, had a, had a great time family gathering, uh,

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:08]** Candied yams is something I never got into, and theirs are delicious.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:09]** Like, really good.

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:15]** But the most memorable food I've ever had for Thanksgiving was when I lived in New Hampshire.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:16]** Our friends got together.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:22]** We did a turdunkin, which is a chicken inside of a duck inside of a turkey.

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:23]** Is that right?

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:25]** And then we deep fried it.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:27]** Almost lit the house on fire.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:29]** And you deep fried it?

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:30]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:34]** My friend bought a deep fryer that was the size of a trash can.

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:35]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:35]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:37]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:39]** Yeah, it was a good time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:39]** Dude, that's bold.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:41]** That's an expensive deep fryer.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:47]** That's also... That's like... I feel like more...

**[00:03:47 - 00:04:13]** fire emergencies happen on thanksgiving from any other holiday yeah than any other time of year it's that it's that principle of displacement that no one ever accounts for when they defry yeah that did occur yeah they don't and then splashed out a little bit yep yep and did it start a fire yeah no we were it was outside yeah it was out on the deck and it snowed the night before so it was okay we're


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:15]** Out on the wooden deck?

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:17]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:20]** Attached to the wooden house.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:21]** No, it's a longer story.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:23]** Anyway, let's not get into that.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:27]** Okay, what I really want to do, though, is I want to go quick around the room.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:30]** I want to hear what you're thankful for as a human.

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:34]** But I also want to hear what your characters are thankful for.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:35]** So we'll do that on the second round.

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:37]** So let's go starting with Will.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:40]** Right now, what are you thankful for this year?

**[00:04:40 - 00:05:05]** way to put me on the spot that's right you're first for this yeah i'm really thankful for our show and our fans oh we're all just gonna say the same you just took all of our responses yeah that's what you get when you give me no prep kev i just i'm always thankful for our fans every day i'm like oh my god i can't people just can't believe people listen to us it's uh yeah it's true same surprising


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:12]** Uh, Vinny, um, this year I am thankful for the medium of music.

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:29]** Um, it's been a bit of an up and a down roller coaster and like, uh, it's sort of ethereal to, to, to put it into those terms, but like it's, it's that one constant that I've kind of had in my life and I've had a lot of, uh, transition, some fun, some not over the last year.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:32]** And I've always had just like

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:38]** an album I could cling to or like ways for me to get my feelings out.

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:46]** And like one of the things that really helped me deal with it and helped me to communicate with other people that I really love has been music.

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:47]** So I'm thankful for music.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:49]** That's so beautiful.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:54]** And also it's kind of, I don't know if it's coincidental that John stopped the music as soon as you started telling us that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:55]** Wait.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:57]** You're trying to rob me of my joy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:58 - 00:05:59]** It starts right back up.

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:01]** Wait, no, no, wait, wait, wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:01]** No, no, no.

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:02]** He didn't stop it.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:03]** That's just his own thing.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:06]** Wait, wait, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:07]** It doesn't matter.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:07]** It doesn't matter.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:09]** Yeah, the music stopped right while he was telling us.

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:13]** So John, start the music back up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:16]** It's been playing this whole time, so I don't know what you're talking about.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:17]** I don't believe you.

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:18]** What are you thankful for?

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:22]** Not Zoom and Sirenscape.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:23]** I'm not thankful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:24]** Hey, don't say that.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:25]** We could still get sponsored by them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:26]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:27]** It's okay.

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:30]** I am very thankful for...

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:45]** Before I say anything about the show, I am very thankful for the opportunity to be engaged and getting a chance to wed my fiance sometime next year.

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:47]** Yeah, it's a wonderful opportunity.

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:53]** And inevitably, it will involve a lot of shenanigans and fun times with the other people on this Zoom call.

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:55]** Oh, shenanigans will be had.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:56]** Wait, I'm invited?


## Speaker_0

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:57]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:28]** uh and then um yeah so that's fun and then i really do have to say that the awesome fact that at some point we were playing dnd and uh we were like you know what we should record this and then i'm playing dnd with venny and then i'm like by the way we're like starting a podcast and then now at this point we are telling stories that everyone out there is like hey i

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:36]** That's a really awesome story that I want to hear more about and connects with me and makes me laugh or makes me feel something.

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:47]** And that is a really, really, really great opportunity and is entirely due to our fans and the audience and just TTRPG and the opportunity to tell awesome stories.

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:50]** So thank you to all of our fans for that.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:51]** Thank you for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:52]** That's so beautiful.

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:55]** Kelly, it's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:56]** Follow that up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:57]** I'm going to stop the music.

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:58]** Yeah, that's really hard.

**[00:07:58 - 00:08:01]** I did actually stop the music just now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:01]** No, no.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:03]** It's not this poignant.

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:04]** You can't do that.

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:10]** Well, outside of the podcast, I'm very grateful for...

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:17]** like friends, which seems like a basic thing, but I've never really, um, it's kind of been not too long ago.

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:28]** The first time in my life where I kind of realized you like true friends were, I think a lot of people kind of hit a certain, they get to like that threshold or whatever, but I got to see who that actually was.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:29]** And it was like really, really cool.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:35]** Um, so to you guys and gals, uh, that's awesome, which includes the people on this podcast.

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:35]** Um,

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:41]** for this podcast, just kind of echoing the early earlier sentiments.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:56]** But it's always in in the back of my head how we have like so many cool listeners that have become our friends, where in our discord, they're just talking daily about what's going on with their lives and supporting each other.

**[00:08:56 - 00:09:00]** There's been a lot of like encouragement amongst all of them and between us and them.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:02]** And it's really neat.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:22]** and i don't know if i should mention who this was but we've we've had one of our listeners slash friends like dm for us um who we met we never would have met if it were not for this podcast and then also we've done some collaborations with some other podcasts and actually john and vinnie and i are doing another one coming up uh we're gonna be recording some more today with them so

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:45]** it's it's kind of cool like it's a really really supportive community that i never would have met if i never met will or anyone else in this group and so i'm really grateful for you guys community at large slash the well man thank you for that too that's an avocado eating dog that's what i always say yeah thanks i wondered what you were thankful for and i'm glad we've got that that's what he's thankful for yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:48]** I guess I'll go too, but I'm just going to echo the same thing.

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:49]** I'm thankful for you guys.

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:52]** I'm thankful for the four of you to be in my life.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:55]** It's great to just have people to play with.

**[00:09:56 - 00:10:01]** But I'm also very thankful to our fans and the TTRPG community.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:11]** There's a lot of great people in this community that I really appreciate more than most humans, I think.

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:18]** But other than that, I do have to say I am thankful for my family, my wife, my son, my daughter to come.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:21]** I love them amazingly.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:22]** They are awesome humans.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:27]** And one day my son will be a TTRPG player for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:29]** Can we have him on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:29]** Yeah.

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:31]** When he's old enough, yeah.

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:33]** What if he doesn't like it?

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:35]** If he doesn't like it, he's not going to be my son anymore.

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:36]** Wow.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:37]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:38]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:38]** That's a joke.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:39]** Jeez.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:42]** Grayson, this is an archive for you in the future.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:45]** Grayson, you can be whatever you want to be, Grayson.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:46]** No, Grayson.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:47]** Do what you want.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:48]** I've been judged since day one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:52]** My son's probably going to grow up calling me a nerd, but cool.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:59]** Speaking of nerdism and playing TTRPGs, I do want to go around real fast because you took a long time to tell me what you're thankful for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:01]** Wait, did Will get to go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:01]** Yeah, he started.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:50]** A future note, let's not do this with all four of them in the room, okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:51]** Do I have the floor?

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:53]** Oh, roll it.

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:53]** Go ahead.

**[00:12:56 - 00:13:00]** I am thankful for my inner guiding light.

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:12]** You laugh, but if only you knew what I knew.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:14]** So over the top.

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:16]** Alright, go on.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:18]** You were really preaching about something.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:19]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:19]** Go.

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:20]** Continue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:21]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:23]** Thank you, Rolu.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:23]** I appreciate that.

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:26]** Thaddeus, you're the last one to go.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:30]** Please refrain from mocking other players.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:31]** No, it's fine.

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:31]** All right, fine.

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:33]** I won't mock anymore, except for this.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:36]** I've always appreciated Rolu talking and saying things.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:37]** It's really funny.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:46]** And also, I appreciate the captain, because he gives me room to do what I like to do in my free time.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:48]** And, yeah.

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:49]** Yeah.

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:57]** And I appreciate my cat family back on Vesk, which Vesk 6 asterisk.

**[00:13:57 - 00:14:02]** You know, they say that cat people are loners, but that's just simply not true.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:03]** We do love our families.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:04]** So, you know.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:05]** Yeah.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:07]** Do you not call each other Patras?

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:11]** Is that not the... I mean... Oh.


## Speaker_0

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:12]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:16]** Do you guys curl up in windows on rainy days?

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:20]** We just bask in the sun together in like a giant pile of cats.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:25]** Cuddle puddle, as they say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:27]** Meow.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:30]** Alright, thank you very much, gentlemen.

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:32]** We're going to cut that there and call it a day.

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:34]** Until next time.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:35]** All right.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:37]** Now, thank you.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:37]** That was fun.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:40]** But it's time to play.

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:43]** Time, time, time to play, play, play, play.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:44]** All right.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:49]** So last time you met a rambunctious, I don't know how to spell that.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:51]** So it's just, I could say it right.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:58]** Rambunctious space goblin named Merc and a rose colored Keshti in a shiny silver space suit.

**[00:14:58 - 00:14:59]** Try saying that seven times fast.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:01]** His name is Keshti.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:06]** They tell you that they are trying to get inside of the great wreckage.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:07]** And how they plan on doing that.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:13]** They only need two more parts to finish off Merc's EMP key, which should work.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:23]** They tell you that they need an electrolytic capacitor from trash hunter territory and that the murder bot picked up the plasma charging circuit not too long ago.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:29]** The trash hunters call the murder bot Tinkerton and they believe it is an avatar of Triune.


## Speaker_0

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:31]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:37]** You also learn that Merc saved cash from the murder bot, and they've been friends ever since.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:44]** So you settle in for the night, and that's when you all get a message that says, Wanted, here's Fabricius.

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:48]** Charges, breaking the oath, and high treason against the pirate captains.

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:51]** There's a big seal for the free captains on top of it.

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:53]** Let me show you that one more time.

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:54]** Show all players.

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:55]** Boom.

**[00:15:56 - 00:15:56]** Can you see it?

**[00:15:57 - 00:15:57]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:57 - 00:15:59]** Such a great graphic.

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:28]** that's right because i drew it i'm so proud of myself uh kev is the resident artist like official like does that so i think kev is the one that that that did the here's character art so you know well you're gonna tell me i should do the other characters no i'm just saying that that that you have done a lot of awesome stuff and then will does all this awesome graphic design and then between the two it's like we don't need to go anywhere else we just got our artists in in house it's great all right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:31]** I'm digging like the smooth criminal vibe.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:33]** Yeah, he does look like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:37]** He's got the MJ pose with his hat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:38]** He's about to do the moonwalk.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:43]** Charges breaking the oath and high treason against the pirate council.


## Speaker_0

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:43]** My God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:45]** Interesting, interesting.

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:51]** But you rusted up the rest of the night and you set out in the morning on your fetch missions.

**[00:16:52 - 00:17:00]** Starting with the electrolytic capacitor, you came across a 40-foot tower of power cords swaying in the breeze and you found three goblins in a trench coat.

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:01]** Ha ha.

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:05]** Not really, but there were three goblins around the base of that tower.

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:12]** And at the end, you actually noticed that one of them was holding the item you're looking for, the electrolytic capacitor.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:13]** That's right.

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:15]** So let's go back to the map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:21]** To fill some air while he's...

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:24]** breathing while he's... Oh, you have something pretentious to say again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:25]** Rolo.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:27]** Rolo, go for it.

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:28]** Fill the air.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:29]** Wow.

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:31]** Or rather, suck all the air out of the room.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:32]** I can't tell if this is true right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:34]** And Rolo or John and Kelly?

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:44]** I thought it was just me, John, but apparently there's some bleed of Kelly's opinion of me, so I'm just gonna leave the Zoom call now, and I'll see you guys in an hour.

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:45]** It was a pure Rolo thing, I swear.

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:46]** For sure.

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:48]** And back to you, Junkmaster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:49]** All right.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:50]** So back to the map.

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:52]** The four of you entered from the southeast side of the map.

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:56]** Vahri 13 actually stayed behind with Merc and Kesh.

**[00:17:56 - 00:18:00]** And there's a tower with three space goblins.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:03]** But also notice there's a Thaster Toad right behind them.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:06]** And the Thaster Toad is actually what alerted them to your presence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:09]** We came with presence.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:09]** And what do you do?

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:14]** So they haven't seen us or they have seen us?

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:15]** Well, they know you're there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:16]** They know we're here.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:18]** And what are they doing?

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:21]** Can I roll perception?

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:22]** Well, you did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:26]** So they were stacked up on top of each other's shoulders.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:28]** They weren't in a trench coat, but they were stacked.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:33]** And they all hopped down and gathered and huddled together.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:41]** And when the faster toad actually alerted them to your presence, they turned, and one of you noticed that they were holding the electrolytic capacitor.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:46]** So you can just assume that they must have retrieved it from that tower.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:48]** Oh, hey, guys over there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:53]** And actually, as you guys approach and say that, the goblins are huddled together.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:56]** And go ahead and roll me.

**[00:18:57 - 00:18:58]** Do any of you speak goblin?

**[00:18:59 - 00:18:59]** Ooh.

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:02]** It's a no from Roland.

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:02]** I don't.

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:04]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:04]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:04]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:05]** It's a no.

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:06]** Oh, that's too bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:08]** Akatonian and common, but not goblin.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:09]** Well.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:10]** Do they speak goblin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:38]** do they speak well they're speaking in goblin yeah as you guys approach you just hear hey try talking to me over here do you raise one of your hands and they they all just kind of stop and look at you do they have weapons out sorry not currently okay we'll leave it at that uh what what's hurry what you want


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:41]** Uh, how much for that thing of a bob you got there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:46]** And they look down at it, and Jack just like, uh, slaps his forehead.

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:48]** No, it's fine.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:49]** Not till I do the trading.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:49 - 00:20:06]** And they look at each other and, And then one of them looks at you and says, Right, how much you want for it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:09]** So that Thastor's Toad is staring at you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:14]** Are we competing against the Thastor Toad as a potential buyer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:15]** Maybe.

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:17]** It raises his hands in a bidding war.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:19]** A little card.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:22]** 500 credits with his tongue.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:27]** So the one goblin that's clenching it tight is probably the leader on this and

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:28]** Which one, T?

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:30]** This one?

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:32]** The one closest to you on the map.

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:34]** Yeah, there you go, that one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:56]** And actually, they're going to kind of step out so they can actually see you a little bit, so give me... So, for the audio-only listeners, this tower is in the center, and we're in the circle, and the goblins are kind of in this arrow pointed at the tower, and they all just sidestepped in perfect formation to the southeast side.

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:58]** Is that how it went down?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:58 - 00:20:59]** Uh-huh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:05]** They all just like... And they all march 10 feet down so they can come closer to us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:07]** It's like West Side Story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:11]** They all start snapping.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:14]** Music starts playing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:16]** That's right.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:17]** My Navy days coming back.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:21]** You're a jet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:23]** When you're a nuclear man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:35]** Now I'm thinking of all... One of my shipmates in school actually did a really good song about drinking grog and sailing all day.

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:36]** It was beautiful.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:40]** We would march to that and all the other classes were like, whoa, that's so cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:42]** Anyways, we need a drop for you, dude.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:46]** Like every time we need to dive, dive, dive, you know, something like that.

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:46]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:49]** Just just the gong.

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:49]** There's a dive gong.

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:50]** There's a dive.

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:51]** All right.

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:51]** Yeah.

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:55]** There's a gong that alerts everybody on the ship that you're about to dive because things happen.

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:56]** Let's do that.

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:56]** Yeah.

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:57]** OK.

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:57]** All right.

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:58]** Back to the game.

**[00:21:58 - 00:22:02]** So you offer you offer to sell and they're like, well, it is ours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:04]** I didn't ask.

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:08]** I asked them how much they'd be willing to part for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:10]** Yeah, but like, what's your offer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:15]** Well, I just want to know what your pot, would you be willing to part with it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:20]** Check.

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:22]** Check.

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:23]** How many?

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:27]** Six billion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:29]** Oh, we can't offer you that.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:30]** How about your knives?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:33]** Jack steps in between the two of them.

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:34]** He holds up his hunting rifle.

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:37]** He's like, I assure you, this is worth seven billion.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:39]** There you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:53]** So as that happens, one of the three goblins actually puts his hand on his junk blaster and actually pulls it out of the holster in response to what Torme just said.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:55]** I think Rolo steps forward.

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:56]** He doesn't raise it, but he pulls it out.

**[00:22:57 - 00:22:58]** He's got it in his hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:58 - 00:23:01]** There's a diplomatic business solution to this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:04]** That there is.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:06]** Diplomatic.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:08]** Is that some kind of device you have?

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:09]** This is a diplomatic hunting rifle.

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:10]** Oh, it's so cool.

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:12]** Diplomatic hunting rifle.

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:25]** It's one of the best.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:28]** Did they just push their price down?

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:29]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:30]** No, no.

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:31]** Your rifle may be $3,000.

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:35]** We want $7,000.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:40]** What if I throw in some rounds for the diplomatic hunting rifle?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:42]** How about a grenade?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:43]** We make seven shiver-diver-divers.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:46]** Salt, salt, salt, salt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:48]** Go ahead.

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:49]** You can either roll me.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:51]** At this point, it's going to be a bluff check, I think.

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:53]** 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:54]** Bluff check for what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:56]** Because he's lying about how much his rifle's worth.

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:58]** He doesn't know what a shiver-diver-diver is.

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:00]** Yeah, but goblins are dumb.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:00]** 13.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:01]** It's fine.

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:02]** Are they dumb?

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:03]** I think they are.

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:04]** We fought them before.

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:04]** Come on.

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:06]** Let's find out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:13]** So one of the goblins actually speaks up in common and says, that thing is not worth seven tradipity.

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:14]** It's not worth even three.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:17]** That thing, junk, worse than our pistols.

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:19]** And I built this myself.

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:23]** And then the other goblin speaks up and is like, Bomb Gozzle's not going to like this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:24]** Who?

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:26]** Yeah, what was that?

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:28]** Bomb Gozzle?

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:29]** Yeah, who is that?

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:30]** Bomb Gozzle, our leader.

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:32]** Bomb Gozzle, Trash Hunter King.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:34]** Oh, where is he?

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:35]** No, don't.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:36]** Hey, shush.

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:37]** Don't you say.

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:38]** Don't you tell me.

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:39]** You're shush.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:40]** Our leader of squad.

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:40]** You're.

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:42]** Does that not squad?

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:43]** Would you talk squad?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:46]** And the other one's finally going to speak up and be like, okay, look.

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:50]** So the bomb guzzle is our leader of all the trash hunters in this area.

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:54]** And bomb guzzle asked us to get this from the tower.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:56]** But I'll be honest.

**[00:24:56 - 00:25:06]** I think tower is a statue of faith to Tinkerton and to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:08]** And I think that taking... Don't tell them this.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:09]** It's not their birth.

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:13]** Why are you telling them that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:17]** We wish to worship Triune in spirit and truth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:19]** They all stopped.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:22]** And they look at each other.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:34]** Go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:37]** Roll me another bluff.

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:38]** Who?

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:41]** Am I going to say Terme on that one unless somebody wants to assist him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:44]** I'll assist him, but I think this is sketchy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:46]** This is a bluff check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:48]** You're lying because you don't praise.

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:49]** Plus two.

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:50]** 29.

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:52]** Come on, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:55]** This has got to work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:56 - 00:26:01]** Check gets on his knees with the blaster still in his branches and he's in front of the thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:24]** all four of rolo's hands come together in a very you know supplement yeah i'm going to propose so i'm gonna i'm gonna um speak telepathically to the team co or crew whatever i'm gonna be like i think what we should do is we should out of piety tell them to put it back


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:26]** And then we steal it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:27]** Okay.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:29]** So two things.

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:35]** I thought you were going to pull one of our old school DD schemes and try to like convince these people that you were true.

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:40]** Anyways.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:41]** No.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:46]** So the other thing is like before you finish communicating that to the group.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:59]** The, the, the one, the gruff one snatches, uh, the capacitor from the other one and says, not, not true.

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:01]** We return.

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:12]** And the other one's like, And they look at you all, and they're like, We're sorry.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:13]** We're sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:13]** We know.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:15]** We were wrong.

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:16]** Bob Gossel did not.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:17]** We put this back.

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:22]** We...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:28]** And they scramble over to the tower and they actually reach up and start stacking on each other's shoulders.

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:32]** It's kind of a mess, but you see them climbing shoulders.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:35]** How heavy is this object?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:36]** It's small.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:37]** It's just a capacitor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:43]** Could I use my... Why can't I remember the names of my skills?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:45]** Not Mage Hand, but the Starfinder version.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:47]** Yeah, the not Mage Hand.

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:52]** Psychokinetic hand to have it float to the top of the tower.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:53]** Go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:55]** Just set it on there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:57]** I feel like they need a check for that.

**[00:27:57 - 00:27:59]** I don't know what check they would need, though, but yeah, it makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:02]** You've got to make a sleight of hand or something so they don't see you doing it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:04]** Yeah, so they don't see you doing it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:10]** Okay, but I was going to do it as part of my reverence and awe of Triune.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:16]** I was going to do a statement-y sort of thing and be like, I shall help Triune.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:26]** You've got to be real careful on this because you've already bluffed them once, but you're lying to these guys, right?

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:29]** This whole time you've been lying.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:35]** If you try to implement more of that, then you're going to have to roll another bluff check and that may or may not work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:54]** sure just okay i'm still gonna help them put it on top of the thing so you don't want to roll a bluff check no i'll you need to roll something so it's either a sleight of hand as if if it's happening on its own sleight of hand okay or do you but do you want me to you're saying that i shouldn't reveal that i'm doing this


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:54 - 00:29:01]** No, no, I'm just saying you are either doing a sleight of hand and not saying anything because you're trying to make it seem as if it's floating on its own.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:02]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:08]** Or you're doing a bluff check by saying, let me help you in the name of Triune, which is a lie because you don't follow Triune.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:11]** Okay, which one is higher, my bluff or my sleight of hand?

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:13]** Sleight of hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:16]** So I think I'm missing the... My bluff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:17]** I'm doing bluff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:35]** i'm missing the the check like is it to not fumble the object or is it to like not fall out of their graces like because it sounds to me like he's just trying to help him put it back yeah that's all yeah yeah so i think i think what i the way i'm picturing it is like these guys are going up to move it themselves right yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:50]** So the sleight of hand I'm going to give you as like you were trying to stealthily, and I think stealth is a wrong term, but you're trying to stealthily manipulate it into place and make them think that it is a spiritual lifting of this thing.

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:54]** Where I think the bluff check is you saying, let me help you.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:57]** I am a part of Triune's whatever.

**[00:29:58 - 00:29:59]** So that's my differentiation of it.

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:01]** If you want to argue that, I'll give you 20 seconds.


## Speaker_0

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:01]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:05]** I'm going to say that Tremé walks up.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:05]** 17.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:06]** 16.

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:14]** He puts out his arms and calls upon some of the... This is all flavor, okay?

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:15]** Where do you walk up to and roll 20?

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:20]** I'm going to say just to the edge of this here.

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:26]** All right, so you stroll up about 10 feet away from the tower.

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:27]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:32]** And I didn't do it, but the three goblins are going to be stacked on top of the goblin closest to the tower at this point.

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:33]** Okay.

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:35]** It's a lot of movement on roll 20.

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:36]** Can they see me, though?

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:38]** Yes, they can see you.

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:40]** You're in broad daylight in the middle of the desert.

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:40]** There's no cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:43]** Well, I mean, there's a tower between us, so, you know.

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:52]** Anyways, Tremé is going to put his arms out in a very reverent sort of way.

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:52]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:52 - 00:31:03]** Approach the tower and say, like, Triune, accept the return of your precious friend.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:06]** Not an artifact, but vessel.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:08]** And then... Cast.

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:17]** With, like, glowing mist, you know, kind of, like, all around his arms from... This is all flavor from, like, the Witch Warper.

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:21]** Maybe I'm, like, channeling some of that Witch Warper energy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:22]** What is it, Force Bolt?

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:24]** You're going to throw Force Bolts at me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:24]** No, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:37]** The hand is, the psychokinetic hand is just going to like come as a, as a, like a gust of wind and sort of just gently lift up the item and place it on top.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:41]** And I think Rolu's going to come and mirror your pose with all four hands.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:45]** So that way I can aid in your bluff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:45]** Okay.

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:46]** Yes.

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:52]** I'm actually going to want, I'm going to let you choose, but like, I'm assuming John, you're going to do an assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:52]** Yeah.

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:54]** I'm assisting on the bluff.

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:55]** Okay.

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:59]** I got a natural 20, which doesn't matter, but 27, so I assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:05]** I got a 18 plus 9 for 27, so 29 on the bluff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:06]** Okay, all right.

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:14]** They have no, like, they're staggering on top of each other, and they're kind of, like, forgot about you for half a second as they, like, go to lift this thing up, and they can't quite reach where they got it from.

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:20]** And then they, like, it starts to lift out of their hands, and they start talking to you.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:31]** And they watch it lift, and then they see you helping, and they're like, And then kind of, the bottom one staggers backwards, and his hands are like,

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:43]** And the other ones are balancing on top, but the capacitor is lifting up into the air and moving into the spot where it came from on the tower, and the tower wobbles just a little too much.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:51]** And then the Tower of Goblins wobbles a little more and fall over, and the three of them spread out and fall.

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:53]** Thank you for helping us.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:53]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:57]** Thank you for helping to learn that the Triune is the true.

**[00:32:57 - 00:33:00]** We follow Triune and his powers.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:02]** All praise Triune.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:05]** Triune will be pleased.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:07]** All praise Triune.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:08]** All praise Triune.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:09]** Triune, you are the best.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:18]** And the faster toad kind of steps down, because that thing's been pretty tense this entire time.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:23]** But as soon as he says that to them, it calms down, and they all go, Thank you.

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:24]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:28]** We really appreciate your guidance on this.

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:34]** I didn't second-guess Baumgasl, but Baumgasl, he's kind of...

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:57]** gone yeah bomb gazelle got gone too far this time bomb gazelle make us turn against june that's true maybe we should remind bomb gazelle what june really means to us and why we need to get to the great wreckage yeah that's that's valid and they turn to you and they say thank you thank you


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:58]** You're welcome.

**[00:33:58 - 00:33:59]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:01]** All for Triune, you know.

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:08]** It's important for us all to look to Triune as individuals.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:10]** Don't be too hard on Bob Gozzle.

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:14]** We all find our own path to Tinkerton and Triune.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:15]** Don't listen to this traitor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:18]** Amazing.

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:23]** And with that, I think they will all bow one more time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:24]** And leave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:27]** And they are gonna take an exit, yeah.

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:28]** Wow.

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:30]** And do you guys let them pass, no problem?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:33]** Yeah, I think Rolo's gonna walk around as if he is in awe.

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:34]** Yeah.

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:35]** And just take everything in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:45]** Yeah, we're going to... So while they're here, like, Tremé's just doing a sort of, like, pensive... You can't tell, because he's got, like, a...

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:54]** Oh man, I should have actually had an added bonus to my bluff check because I'm hooded right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:55]** Because you needed it, right?

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:58]** Might as well make it 35.

**[00:34:58 - 00:35:00]** No, it would have been a 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:04]** It would have been 31, but it's fine.

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:34]** yeah uh termay is just sort of like pensively meditating you can maybe hear like you know he's speaking in uh maybe cyrunian with like little utterings of like triune in in that speckled in so you like you could you could hear him talking in his language and then triune so he's he's trying to sell the bluff do you need to roll another buff check they're they're there to worship


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:37]** I think for that, you're going to roll another bluff check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:37]** Didn't they leave?

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:38]** Aren't they gone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:39]** Yeah.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:40]** I mean, they're on their way out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:41]** Natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:42]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:42]** There it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:43]** 42.

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:45]** For a 100.

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:46]** For a 28.

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:49]** Check offers like high fives on the way out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:51 - 00:36:18]** yeah rola was thinking of some questions to ask but you can still catch them they're like they're you know still within earshot so if you shot down like hey they might turn around all right are they gone is the coast clear well rola did you want to ask them anything nope okay i don't want to risk it it's all it's all gone dang all right cool i'm gonna grab it with the same same way that i put it up there

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:21]** Okay, before you do that, I need a perception check.

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:22]** Oh, from who?

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:23]** Everybody?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:24]** Sure.

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:24]** 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:27]** 19.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:28]** 18.

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:29]** Sorry, 16.

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:30]** Less than all this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:31]** There it is.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:32]** Okay.

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:39]** So you don't see the goblins anymore, but you do sense that something is watching you.

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:40]** Do you still want to proceed?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:43]** What would be watching me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:45]** And who got that sense?

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:45]** Everybody?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:46]** Can we find out where it is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:48]** Anybody who rolled above an 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:52]** How do I know that I'm being watched?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:53]** You just sense it.

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:53]** You feel it.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:54]** That's your perception.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:55]** It's your skin crawling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:59]** Could we do a roll to identify where and what that might be?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:03]** You could roll a higher perception, which you didn't.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:08]** Take that information for what it is and choose to go in what direction you want to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:09]** Cool.

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:23]** jack is uh quite impulsive as we've discovered um so he's immediately like scampering up to the tower to like inspect its climb worthiness wait jack what wait wait wait what are we waiting for they're gone


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:27]** Thaddeus just whispers to me, did you see that?

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:30]** Do you feel something?

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:31]** Something's here.

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:34]** Let's be ready.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:36]** You're saying I have a bad feeling about this?

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:38]** Is that where we're going with?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:40]** I have a very bad feeling about this.

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:42]** That's not trademarked or anything, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:52]** I was trying to look at if I had some sort of environmental witch warper thing that I could maybe conceal around it.

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:55]** The negotiations were short, which they were.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:57 - 00:37:58]** Bro, who's going to cast Detect Magic?

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:00]** Yeah, that's a good idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:02]** Okay, go ahead and read off Detect Magic for me.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:02]** Sure.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:05]** Detect Magic, as provided by Hero Lab.

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:06]** Thank you, Hero Lab.

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:27]** You detect all magic spells, effects, items, and objects, including those on or affecting creatures, you can see, as well as hybrid items in the area, which is a 60-foot area, cone-shaped, so I can give you an area if you want.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:34]** You can't detect magical traps as they are created with additional magic that wards them from the spell.

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:47]** Each round you concentrate on the same area, you can determine if one magic source you detect is from a spell, magic item, or other effect, and the caster level of the effect.

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:58]** You can't determine if there are magic sources in areas you can't see, or if there was a magic source in an area at one time, but that has since expired.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:05]** Okay, so from that, what you see is... I assume you see, like, wisps of energy that start to glow.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:09]** And that's what gives you the identification of what is magic and not.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:13]** And you can clearly see that, you know, some of you have magic abilities.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:16]** So, like, Rolu, you look at your own hands and they're glowing.

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:16]** Yeah.

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:19]** I don't think Thaddeus does and Chak doesn't.

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:23]** But Tremay's has almost got this aura around him.

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:26]** And there is this...

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:31]** Almost like a fairy dust trail traveling up and swirling around the tower.

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:35]** And you can't quite tell what's Tremé's and what's not.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:38]** You don't have that ability to distinguish.

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:42]** But you don't sense anything else, especially not the traps that are around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:57]** what do you sense especially not the traps that are definitely around that could also speak kev uh you know junk mastering the red hair yeah the classic red herring for the redhead i don't

**[00:39:57 - 00:40:02]** I don't sense anything, Thaddeus.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:12]** There seems to be nothing except Tremé's connection to this tower, but there could be something here with the tower itself.

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:15]** Or with the device, it's a little unclear.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:16]** I do also appreciate you asking.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:18]** You never ask me these things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:21]** I'm always interested in your world.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:22]** Always.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:25]** Well...

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:28]** We need it, so we're going to have to get it.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:32]** But there might be a trap, so weapons out, spells ready.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:32]** Cool.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:32]** Here we go.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:34]** And Chuck starts climbing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:35]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:38]** Antonio, you might want to lift it down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:38]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:41]** Can I just... It's like a kinetic hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:43]** We could probably try both at the same time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:52]** Chuck's just chasing after it.


## Speaker_0

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:54]** Uh...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:56]** Could I also cast Mending on the tower?

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:57]** Would that help?

**[00:40:57 - 00:41:01]** Because it seems to be unstable, so if we're worried about this falling or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:04]** Is Mending a zero-level spell?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:05]** What does that do?

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:10]** Yeah, it repairs damage objects and constructs, restoring 1d4 hit points.

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:15]** It's a range of 10 feet, but it is not touched.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:17]** But for a second there, I thought it was.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:20]** It can also remove the broken condition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:27]** Okay, so with that, I'm going to say you can't use that because this tower isn't necessarily damaged or broken.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:32]** But if you want, I will let you do an engineering check to see if you can stabilize it.

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:34]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:39]** I paused because I was like, does Rolo care about that?

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:41]** And Rolo would care about that.

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:45]** That would be a 23.

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:46]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:48]** I'll take note of that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:51]** I was waiting for the crit fail and you knock over the darn thing.

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:57]** Yeah, that's what I was... The problem is that Rolo's curious, so probably not best.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:02]** So then now you said Treme is going to just let a hand to pull it out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:08]** Yeah, he's going to take a step back just to be out of the... Is sleight of hand the best?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:13]** There's definitely a check for this, for removing that, but it's not necessarily sleight of hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:15]** Well, I don't know what else it would be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:17]** I think just a will save.

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:19]** Will save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:23]** You point your finger with will save.

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:24]** I don't know that will.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:28]** I wouldn't go will because it's a check of his magical dexterity.

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:29]** Right?

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:31]** So it's a casting?

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:34]** Yeah, I think I would make it a casting check.

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:36]** Whatever your spellcasting modifier is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:38]** Yeah, there's a casting.

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:41]** You should have a casting bonus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:45]** Like whichever ability modifier you add to your spellcasting.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:46]** Charisma.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:48]** So yeah, I would go with that.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:50]** But I'm not the Junk Master.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:56]** Okay, well, I got a 19 on the die, plus three charisma, 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:57 - 00:43:04]** Are you about to say he needed a natural 20 to do this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:06]** No, I said that's enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:07]** Okay.

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:11]** I was going to say, because Torme just moved back on the 20.

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:15]** I thought it was going to move back.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:17]** I thought it was moving back in case it fell over.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:29]** I was just going to say, like, Rolo's north of the tower, Chaka's south of the tower, within 10 feet, and Thaddeus has wisely stayed, like, 30 feet away, and Jermaine is like, I don't like this magical.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:31]** Have you guys ever played Giant Jenga?

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:33]** Like, in the yard?

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:34]** Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:39]** You know when you pull one, and you can see it teetering, and not do anything about it?


## Speaker_0

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:39]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:39 - 00:44:03]** yeah that's that's exactly how i feel as the gm right now um you so you pull out that jenga piece using your psychokinetic hand you see that you pull out a jenga piece it was from the top you pull out a jenga piece essentially uh and this capacitor slides out and it floats to the ground this whole tower is waving back and forth but it stays stable


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:05]** Which side does it slide out of?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:06]** Yeah.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:08]** The southwest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:10]** Okay, so Shaq would have seen it slide out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:14]** What does that do with anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:18]** So, like, I imagine he was about to start climbing and seeing it removed.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:19]** He's like, oh, fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:20]** Oh, okay, yeah, yeah.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:23]** See, like, the shadow over you starts to pull out.

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:26]** You, like, start balancing underneath it like you're going to catch it if it falls.

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:28]** Make a net with your leaves.

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:28]** He's like, shh.

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:31]** Like a crab.

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:37]** Yeah, so you manage to get it to the ground and you guys collect this capacitor.

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:38]** The tower stays up.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:50]** I just want to let you know it wasn't necessarily a trap and it was less to do with the tower actually collapsing.

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:53]** and more to do with what that tower represents.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:56]** I see.

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:58]** It's a spirit of something here, then, maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:58 - 00:45:01]** It strikes me as a religious shrine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:03]** Yeah, of course.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:06]** They said it is a tower to Tinkerton and Trian.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:06]** Right.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:11]** So if we were to deface it, then bad juju on us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:12]** Very bad juju.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:17]** But bad juju from Trian, because Tinkerton is just the large...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:38]** mech also right they were they were going to deface it as well the goblins i'm saving i'm preserving it i'm like i'm like nick cage and national treasure sorry john what did you say about and tinkerton isn't tinkerton the robot so tinkerton it's the quote-unquote murder bot


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:40]** That was you just trying to plug Murderbot.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:47]** So it's the Murderbot, but Triune seems to be the actual force.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:51]** It's canon now in, we'll say, the Interstellar Tales of the actual Galactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:53]** That is a true Murderbot.

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:54]** I'm just saying.

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:55]** That is a true Murderbot.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:56]** Okay, no, that's what, yes.

**[00:45:56 - 00:46:06]** And as for what Will is saying is, yes, in the eyes of the goblins, you helped reestablish their connection to Triune because they were actually teetering on that concept themselves.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:08]** They were like, should we help them or should we not?

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:09]** And they finally revealed it.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:18]** But they were arguing amongst themselves about what was the right thing to do because Bomb Guzzle told them, I need this part for something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:18]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:21]** And they said they're trying to get into that great wreckage.

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:22]** Right.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:27]** And so if they were to come back and see this thing collapsed, you were the last ones there.

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:30]** So just take that for what it is.

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:32]** And where do you guys want to go next?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:39]** Hey, now that we've got this part, should we track those goblins and figure out why this bomb gazelle is trying to get in?

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:41]** Or should we take it back to where we got it?

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:43]** Where we need to take it to?

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:46]** I think that we should track them down and shoot them in the back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:49]** Right, is that what Thaddeus says?

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:50]** Oh, was that me?

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:52]** Was that you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:55]** Was that Thaddeus as a murder bot?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:57]** I was just guessing.

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:01]** Thaddeus hears from his left shoulder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:05]** I think we should just press on.

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:06]** No.

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:10]** I don't want to investigate the goblins, because then I don't want to have to lie to them some more.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:12]** No, I don't like space goblins.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:16]** I'm sure that we'll encounter whatever the f*** that guy is again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:22]** Yeah, I'm sure we'll have to lie our way out of another situation, but... He'll definitely be a recurring non-player character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:29]** Let's go back to... Yeah, let's go return the...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:33]** Are we returning it or are we finding the other piece?

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:35]** I feel like... Isn't there two pieces?

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:38]** What was the other piece that we had to find again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:39]** Are there two pieces?

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:39]** That's up to you.

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:52]** You can go back to Merc and Cash and give them this part, but there is still the... Oh my gosh, I got to mom except electrolytic capacitor and then the plasma charging array or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:52]** Yeah.

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:54]** Any hints on where that might be?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:57]** That was going to be... Sorry, I'm a terrible GM.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:59]** That's where Tinkerton is, right?

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:00]** Presumably.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:10]** Yeah, well, so Merc told you that she had the plasma charging... Array or whatever.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:11]** Device.

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:13]** I'm trying to search my notes at the same time I'm talking.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:13]** It's hard.

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:20]** But she had the device in her hands when Tickerton came into view.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:22]** And she dropped it and scrambled away.

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:23]** She was afraid.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:28]** She was more fearful for her life than she wanted to get into this...

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:30]** great wreckage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:32]** Plasma charging circuit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:33]** Circuit!

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:34]** That's the word I was looking for, not array.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:36]** Thank you.

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:40]** Do we have any leads on how to find this Tinkerton?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:45]** So Merc told you exactly... Yeah, Merc said where to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:46]** Oh, dang.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:47]** That's a clever thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:49]** I didn't hear that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:55]** If we knock over this thing, do we summon the Murderbot?

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:57]** Can we get two birds and one stone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:57 - 00:49:03]** But the plasma charging circuit was dropped by Merc, right?

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:05]** But then Tinkerton picked it up, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:07]** Yeah, Tinkerton picked it up.

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:10]** She saw Tinkerton grab it and pick it up as she ran off.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:13]** So that is the question.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:14]** You kind of have three options at this point.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:17]** You can either topple over this tower and see what happens.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:24]** You could go to where Merc said she dropped it and you can try to track the murder bot from there.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:30]** or you can go back to Merc and Cash and give them the electrolytic capacitor.

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:32]** Which way do you want to go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:36]** I don't want to knock over this thing just willy-nilly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:41]** Yeah, I think if there's an option to find Tinkerton, we should do that.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:42]** I agree.

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:50]** I think we should go try and find Tinkerton, because this isn't just a Tinkerton, this is also... Chuck, I just don't want to upset the locals.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:54]** Yeah, I don't want these goblins to rush back and sh**.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:58]** There's something to be said for not creating enemies unnecessarily.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:01]** We'd also be creating... Chuck's so upset.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:02]** Fine!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:03]** Let's not destroy it then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:06]** We'll destroy it later, okay?

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:11]** Chuck slowly puts more explosives back in your bag.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:12]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:17]** Of course not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:19]** Hashtag callback.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:19]** Okay.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:20]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:22]** Well, shall we be off?

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:31]** There's also something to be said for upsetting Triun, who has a much larger... Might create a crisis in the drift.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:32]** Who knows?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:35]** We would not want to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:36]** Wow.

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:41]** So you guys want to just head straight to where Merc told you to go?

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:42]** Yeah, I think it's a good idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:49]** I'm trying to decide if Rolo would recommend to safely move this object back to the people who need it so we can get into the ship.

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:51]** Because remember, that's what we're trying to do.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:53]** We're trying to get the right things to get in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:55]** But we need both pieces to get back in the ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:57]** But we could drop one off so we don't lose another one.

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:59]** Although, have we lost another one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:02]** We don't really get mobbed for items, yeah.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:02]** Yeah.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:04]** I don't think that's, like, a thing, right?

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:05]** Not yet.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:06]** This is a Kev game.

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:07]** Why give Kev a game?

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:08]** Yeah, I know.

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:14]** He's going to be like, well, you get tackled, and now you're out in the form of your lowest check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:19]** You've got ten seconds to decide whether you go back or head out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:25]** I think it could be good to give Merc and Kesh some time to use the object and get to know.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:30]** Because as I'm thinking about it now, I do recall... There might be some crafting time involved.

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:31]** Exactly.

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:34]** And as I'm thinking about it, we should have asked the...

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:57]** trash hunters more about uh what they knew about how to get in because i i recall murk and cashing that they almost made it in as well so it would have been good to ask them about the what they knew of the grid wreckage but perhaps we'll see them uh if they try to mob us again for this device or anything along the way okay yeah let's do it let's head back then yeah yes so i guess we head back yeah

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:59]** So off we go.

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:00]** So where are we going?

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:01]** Off we go.

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:03]** Going back to Merc and Kesh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:09]** I'm hesitant to follow Rolu, but... What else is new?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:15]** Okay, so you guys head back to Merc and Kesh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:23]** I guess I can... I was like, I made you this option, but I had no idea how to prep for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:24]** Can I ask...

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:49]** no thaddeus for sure is not down with trusting rolu but i was thinking about this the other day rolu is the like chief of the boat so like he technically is the most ranking official is it just that and like i thought that like termay my project manager is technically in charge of our project


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:51]** Hope he doesn't listen to the show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:52]** Yeah, right?

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:55]** It's kind of like... And I don't work there anymore!

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:56]** Jokes.

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:56]** Just kidding.

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:59]** Thaddeus, for sure, is like... I love my job.

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:02]** Definitely not trying to take commands from Rolu.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:07]** But I'm asking Chak and Terme, because I think in Rolu's mind, he is like...

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:12]** He's aware of just other things, obviously, outside of the ship.

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:19]** But I think in his mind, he still feels like Termay and Chak are at least not begrudging.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:21]** He doesn't get that sense from you.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:26]** So I'm curious if that's what are Chak and Termay actually thinking?

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:29]** And does it have to do with what you got from here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:31]** Why would I tell you what I'm thinking?

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:33]** Okay, I was just asking as a player.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:35]** Rolu's actually asking, right?

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:37]** Yeah, it's not Rolu asking.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:38]** Let's hear it.

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:39]** Does Rolu ask?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:40]** No, I'm asking.

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:41]** So, right.

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:51]** I think Chak is like, he's, he's here, but he's, he's never really been a combat like asset.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:54]** He's here basically for the lulz.

**[00:53:56 - 00:54:01]** So he's following Rolu, but he's also stirring the pot.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:08]** Like what ways can I interject that will create conflict for his own amusement?

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:39]** yeah so in those ways yeah he'll he'll back rolu to create conflict between him and termain thaddeus he'll back thaddeus to create conflict between him and termain rolu like it's just he's just stirring pots and seeing what comes out yeah yeah just like around he's like the jar jar banks but like intentionally trying to like yeah he's he's darth jar jar you're saying he's a sith lord he's darth jar jar exactly definitely darth check precisely what about termain


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:43]** I mean, Tremé is on the fence, I feel like.

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:47]** He doesn't want to reveal his hand.

**[00:54:47 - 00:55:04]** And he definitely... He's got his suspicions, especially after the sort of bulletin and seeing here's his name pop up and your association that he knows of with that person and communication.

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:09]** So he's definitely looking at you with a different light, but...

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:16]** I mean, Torme is also not a stranger to dealing with fugitives, so he's not like... We are pirates.

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:29]** This thing sort of is... It's not uncommon for the, you know, free captains to put out a bounty on somebody, and maybe they take it back.

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:30]** Maybe new evidence comes to light.

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:31]** I don't know.

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:31]** Who knows?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:32]** Okay, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:36]** I'm counting on...

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:40]** You revealing your intentions at some point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:44]** Looks like you're losing your grip on the group, Roland.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:47]** But, as you say... I'm sorry, I was just walking.

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:50]** I didn't say anything as a person, so I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:52]** No, no, no.

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:53]** Thaddeus is going to say that anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:56]** He just walks up next to you and whispers in your ear.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:57]** Thaddeus, it's interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:59]** Looks like you're losing touch.

**[00:55:59 - 00:55:59]** It's interesting.

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:01]** His whisker, like, tickles you.

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:01]** Yeah, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:02]** It's interesting, Thaddeus.

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:09]** I've always had a certain light touch when it comes to leadership.

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:17]** I don't know that being the most bossy necessarily gets you the respect.

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:18]** that you deserve.

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:21]** So it's interesting that you say I'm losing my touch.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:27]** I just, and, and again, this is why I asked you as players, cause Rolu is not going to like come out and ask you like what you think of him.

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:31]** He, cause he's not going to be the person who's like, all right, let's squat up and go do this.

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:32]** And you're going to do this.

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:34]** And it's like, that's not, I think his leadership style.

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:37]** So I was just asking you as a player, but, uh,

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:42]** Yeah, that's my thoughts on leadership, Rolu, that were unsolicited.

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:48]** But it seems like maybe you need to broaden your horizons maybe to get the results that you need.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:53]** There's a fine line between a light touch and a lack of will to action.

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:55]** You know what I mean, Rolu?

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:57]** And we could debate this some other time, but... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:58 - 00:57:00]** Are you looking at some leadership books?

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:05]** There's also... Yes, I... It sounds like maybe you need to know where that line is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:05]** I highly...

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:10]** recommend how to win pirates and influence pirates.

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:12]** It's pretty good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:16]** You should also read how to win non-pirates and influence non-pirates.

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:18]** It's a really nice supplement.

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:22]** I'm not taking tips from you, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:27]** The lesser known how to win plants and influence plants has been really good, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:30]** I heard that was a bestseller.

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:33]** I'm a fan of The Advantage.

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:36]** I think that's a book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:39]** I haven't heard of that one, Torme.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:40]** I'll have to see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:42]** How to win...

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:46]** Witch warpers that influence witch warpers is also a good one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:51]** That sounds like a very industry-specific... It might, you know, it could have some ramifications.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:58]** Some author is making a... It's number one in markets among witch warpers, but that's about it.

**[00:57:58 - 00:58:00]** It's actually pretty low on the...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:03]** Whoever made these books is just replacing racial names.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:09]** It's kind of like the Anything for Dummies series.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:11]** Chicken Soup for the Soul.

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:14]** If you go to page 100, is it the same as your page 100?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:19]** We're just bumping their books together.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:21]** Sorry, this is very important.

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:23]** Now that you mention it, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:29]** All of them are owned and copyrighted by Paizo.

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:57]** so you guys are making your way back you're swinging right past the stellar flare wreckage and the tent that Kesha and Merc were set up in kind of it's on your path back to where Merc told you the murder bot is so as you guys are strolling up you guys are having this pretty loud argument but it's kind of broken off when Merc sees you


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:22]** oh welcome back did you did you get everything i forgot about the australian lizard guy not not quite everything uh rolu wanted to check in with you mostly to see uh if you'd made any progress we did find this however which uh termay pulls out the electrolytic capacitor


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:33]** And you hand it back to her, and as you do, the little green script on top of your screen that says electrolytic capacitor turns to gold and gets checked off.

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:35]** Mission accomplished.

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:36]** Yeah.

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:38]** I think there's still one more green bar, though.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:39]** There's like a, yeah.

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:40]** Yeah.

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:46]** And they take it, and she runs off, and Vari kind of steps up and says, that seemed to go well.

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:48]** You came back fairly quickly.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:53]** Should I join you on the next leg?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:53 - 01:00:13]** yeah why wouldn't you i think it could jack says i i think this is this one might get a little more dicey than the last one we're supposed to be going head to head with a murder bot i i heard that term but i'm not quite sure what to make of it do you believe that there is actually a creature of that magnitude absolutely


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:14]** I think it could be the case.

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:29]** We were fortunate that our crew is adept at handling situations, negotiating them tactfully, and I don't know if this next situation can be handled as such.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:31]** I will trust your judgment.

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:37]** You seem very knowledgeable of the ways of the world, and I would not doubt you in any way.

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:40]** I will remain behind with Kesh and Merc.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:42]** The ways of the world.

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:42]** Thank you.

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:44]** Are we talking about Rolu right now?

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:46]** I've never been in cold culture.

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:48]** We're talking about Rolu, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:51]** I imagine those laughs are actually Thaddeus and Torme.

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:53]** They're just in the back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:58]** You see Rolu swell up like...

**[01:00:58 - 01:01:20]** yes there you go oh man so cute you see what a light touch does that is when you enable others to all right success that was page 96 i think we all read it the same text on the same book in the same book i think i think they might have a little crush over here i don't know what's going on


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:53]** my favorite thing about these books is they're sold on the same rack like the name tags so it's like exactly the same but just highlighted out uh cool okay so you turn you drop off the item they scurry away and start working on it um vari asks whether they should join you and you definitely tell them no you you should stay behind are we are we talking to them from like across the the thing oh man i'm just lazy it didn't move you over on the map all right look here we shouting from this distant location i was enjoying the role play

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:57]** Chuck stays over in the corner.

**[01:01:58 - 01:02:09]** So for the listener, they were kind of spread out across probably 20, 40 yards or 40 feet on the map and I just moved all their tokens over so they'd be actually in communicating distance.

**[01:02:09 - 01:02:12]** And now I'm going to move all the way because you guys are walking away, right?

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:13]** Is there anything else you want to do while you're here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:14 - 01:02:19]** Yeah, do you know where you last saw the plasma charging circuit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:20 - 01:02:29]** Yeah, Merc break down and tell you, like, she points in one direction and she says, I went down this road and then I made a left at that point.

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:30]** Can you draw a map?

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:58]** oh yeah yeah sure sure sure sure and in the sand uh she starts scraping out you know a diagram of of where and she's drawn actually like really almost detailed as best you can in the sand detailed drawings of the different types of wreckages you'll see along the way and make a left at the big yellow arches uh and make a right at the shop looking chip check pulls out his data pad and starts snapping pictures at the golden arches


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:58 - 01:03:20]** beautiful and then he flips the camera around and pops a selfie with the pictures check can i get in that i want to get a selfie with you oh sure sure sure can you get my other side actually i prefer the left side of my hook check climbs up and puts like one leg on each of their shoulders and they just like all three making a tripod uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:20 - 01:03:43]** uh cool murk and kesh i wanted to ask we we did meet some trash hunters uh we were they talked about what's the name of their thing bomb gardener bomb bomb bomb guzzle yes bomb guzzle yeah bomb guzzle bomb guzzle uh what does he do bomb bomb guzzle can you tell us more about bump guzzle


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:03:43 - 01:03:47]** Bomb Gazoo is kind of the leader of the trash hunters.

**[01:03:48 - 01:03:51]** He, I mean, he's just another goblin.

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:56]** He does have, he kind of built himself some armor.

**[01:03:56 - 01:04:00]** He's known to be the most, like, ingenuitive.

**[01:04:00 - 01:04:01]** Is that the word?

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:02]** I think that's the word.

**[01:04:03 - 01:04:04]** No, it's intuitive.

**[01:04:05 - 01:04:06]** No, that's not.

**[01:04:06 - 01:04:08]** And she starts kind of knocking her head.

**[01:04:08 - 01:04:33]** not um it's uh ingenuous he's the smartest one he's the smartest of he's almost the smartest yeah you're definitely more smarter than he is and they just started kind of like talking to each other more than they're talking to you you know he's probably read how to win friends and influence goblins how to win friends and influence the questions how to win friends and influence goblins uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:33 - 01:04:58]** uh they're kind of giggling back and forth and you know start communicating with each other but you did pick up that bomb guzzle is the leader of the space goblins in this area and that he may or may not have built himself more than just a suit of armor so is this is this like a pigeon in a suit of armor like we we should be fine but or or do we need to be concerned about this guy


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:59 - 01:05:02]** Have you seen Bumguzzle in person?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:05:02 - 01:05:03]** Yes, Bumguzzle.

**[01:05:04 - 01:05:05]** I used to be a trash hunter.

**[01:05:06 - 01:05:06]** Oh, really?

**[01:05:07 - 01:05:08]** That makes sense.

**[01:05:08 - 01:05:09]** Tell me more about that.

**[01:05:10 - 01:05:13]** But I was... I mean... What more do you want?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:05:13 - 01:05:14]** Trash hunters?

**[01:05:15 - 01:05:16]** All goblins count trash hunters.

**[01:05:16 - 01:05:18]** But I was like, man, I don't want to be a trash hunter no more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:05:19 - 01:05:20]** And now I'm friends with Cash.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:05:20 - 01:05:22]** I like you around here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:05:22 - 01:05:23]** I want to hear stories.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:23 - 01:05:25]** But I don't think we have time for it right now.

**[01:05:25 - 01:05:27]** We have a robot to hunt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:27 - 01:05:31]** It's a much richer life to forge your own path, isn't it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:05:31 - 01:05:39]** It is said that Bomb Gazel was actually working to defend the trash hunters against Tinkerton.

**[01:05:39 - 01:05:42]** As much as they praise Tinkerton, they don't trust it.

**[01:05:43 - 01:05:44]** No, no, Tinkerton dangerous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:05:44 - 01:05:55]** Tinkerton murder bot, but they think murder bot of like glory and that like death by the murder bot is reasonable and worth it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:05:55 - 01:05:58]** That's why I leave trash hunters.

**[01:05:58 - 01:06:01]** That's not very good.

**[01:06:01 - 01:06:02]** So take with that what you will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:03 - 01:06:03]** Okay.

**[01:06:03 - 01:06:03]** I see.

**[01:06:04 - 01:06:08]** Do you think it's worth going to talk to the trash hunters to see if they want to


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:08 - 01:06:11]** I think it's not worth, in that sense.

**[01:06:11 - 01:06:13]** I think it's... I don't know.

**[01:06:14 - 01:06:19]** They're not going to help us defeat the murder bot.

**[01:06:19 - 01:06:20]** Wait, they're not?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:20 - 01:06:22]** I thought they might.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:23 - 01:06:25]** It depends on what you mean by help us defeat.

**[01:06:25 - 01:06:28]** It sounds like they would be willing fodder, but...

**[01:06:28 - 01:06:34]** But that also seems way too Machiavellian for my taste.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:45]** I feel like they might be like, oh, you guys would be a nice sacrifice for the robot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:46 - 01:06:47]** We should do it.

**[01:06:47 - 01:06:51]** We should try to get them to help us out in whatever way that is, including perhaps combat.

**[01:06:52 - 01:06:53]** I think it could be good to ask.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:53 - 01:06:54]** Couldn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:06:54 - 01:07:14]** let's do it they're friendly to us now maybe it's been he's very much not like yeah they're friendly can you point us yeah bluff checks are not diplomacy checks just to clarify that um okay so are you guys done here and you're gonna head out and try to find the trash hunters or you're gonna just go to where yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:14 - 01:07:19]** I think we should not do the trash hunters, but for the sake of role-playing, I want to go find the trash hunters.

**[01:07:20 - 01:07:21]** This is a role-playing game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:22 - 01:07:22]** Yeah.

**[01:07:22 - 01:07:27]** Can you just point out where Bumguzzle lives?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:07:27 - 01:07:29]** I don't know.

**[01:07:30 - 01:07:31]** They are hermetic.

**[01:07:32 - 01:07:34]** Hermetic?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:35 - 01:07:36]** Nomadic?

**[01:07:36 - 01:07:36]** Nomadic.

**[01:07:37 - 01:07:38]** They keep to themselves.

**[01:07:39 - 01:07:40]** Nomadic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:07:40 - 01:07:42]** No, it means that they don't quite live in the same area.

**[01:07:42 - 01:07:43]** Nomadic.

**[01:07:44 - 01:07:47]** They move around the junk, the outer junk fields.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:47 - 01:07:47]** Like hermits, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:48 - 01:07:49]** I think we should just look for the...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:49 - 01:08:04]** for the trash should we so their fiefdom is not like they move around their own they're not gonna understand that they have a territory that they frequent or do they can you tell us about the geopolitical alliances in this area


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:08:07 - 01:08:10]** So you know that the trash hunters and the unbrood.

**[01:08:12 - 01:08:14]** Okay.

**[01:08:14 - 01:08:19]** So I will let you try to do survival checks to track down the goblins if you want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:19 - 01:08:20]** Yeah, I think that's fair.

**[01:08:20 - 01:08:21]** Sure, I'll do that.

**[01:08:22 - 01:08:22]** Okay.

**[01:08:23 - 01:08:23]** Let's see.

**[01:08:24 - 01:08:26]** I say as I have a plus zero survival.

**[01:08:26 - 01:08:27]** 17.

**[01:08:27 - 01:08:27]** One.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:27 - 01:08:31]** I got three fingers up for those on the audio medium.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:31 - 01:08:34]** And that's 3 times 10, so you got a 30.

**[01:08:35 - 01:08:35]** Sweet.

**[01:08:35 - 01:08:35]** 17.

**[01:08:35 - 01:08:37]** The highest is 17.

**[01:08:38 - 01:08:39]** Okay, I will roll.

**[01:08:40 - 01:08:41]** Hold on.

**[01:08:41 - 01:08:41]** I got a 19.

**[01:08:43 - 01:08:43]** There we go.

**[01:08:44 - 01:08:45]** And you head out into the desert.

**[01:08:47 - 01:08:48]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:50 - 01:08:50]** Oh!

**[01:08:51 - 01:08:52]** All right.
