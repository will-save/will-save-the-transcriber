## Types of Contributions

We welcome contributions in two main areas:

### 1. Transcription Corrections
Help improve the accuracy of transcribed episodes by correcting:
- Speaker attribution errors
- Mistranslations
- Punctuation and formatting
- Character and place names
- Starfinder/Pathfinder terminology

### 2. Development Contributions
Help improve the transcription scripts by:
- Enhancing diarization accuracy
- Adding Starfinder vocabulary dictionaries
- Optimizing performance
- Adding new features
- Fixing bugs

## Transcription Corrections

### How to Submit Corrections

1. **Find the Episode**: Locate the episode file in the `episodes/` directory
   - Files are organized by series: `episodes/[series_name]/[episode_title].md`
   - Example: `episodes/threefold_conspiracy_book_1/episode_1_title.md`

2. **Create an Issue**: Use the [Transcription Correction template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/transcription_correction.md)
   - Provide the exact file path
   - Include current and corrected text
   - Specify the type of correction needed

3. **Submit a Pull Request**: 
   - Fork the repository
   - Make your corrections
   - Use the proper commit message format (see below)
   - Submit a PR with a clear description

### Commit Message Format

For transcription corrections, use this format:
```
[type]: [description of changes]
```

**Types:**
- `speaker`: Speaker attribution corrections
- `mistranslation`: Incorrect word/phrase corrections
- `punctuation`: Punctuation and formatting fixes
- `character`: Character or place name corrections
- `terminology`: Starfinder/Pathfinder term corrections
- `formatting`: Markdown formatting issues

**Examples:**
```
speaker: fixed speaker attribution for Will in episode 15
mistranslation: corrected "app" to "ep" (short for episode)
speaker/mistranslation: changed Speaker_0 to Will and fixed "star finder" to "Starfinder"
punctuation: added missing commas and periods
character: corrected "Keskodai" to "Keskodai" throughout episode
terminology: updated "solarian" to "Solarian" class references
```

### File Organization

**Important**: Maintain the exact file structure and naming conventions:
- Directory names: `threefold_conspiracy_book_1`, `unknown_treasures`, etc.
- File names: Use the exact sanitized title from the script
- File paths: `episodes/[series_directory]/[episode_title].md`

The script relies on this structure to skip already transcribed episodes.
